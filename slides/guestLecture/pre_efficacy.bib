  abstract = {Much attention has been paid to the effects of political efficacy and trust on political participation. Most studies tend to use efficacy or trust as an independent variable to explain political actions such as voting, campaign involvement, and the like. Despite their importance in explanations of political behavior, relatively little is known regarding mechanisms through which social involvement may influence trust and efficacy. If efficacy and trust are of value, then it is important that we determine how their development can be fostered, and especially whether their development can be promoted through social interaction\textemdash such as a sense of community. Borrowing from the field of community psychology, I employ the Sense of Community Index to provide a more nuanced measure of community based on individual perceptions of their community that previous studies were unable to capture. Analyzing original survey data, this paper examines to what extent, if any, a sense of community matters for trust and efficacy. The results demonstrate that social forces, such as community, exert positive and significant effects on internal and external efficacy and personal and political trust, independently of individual traits such as income, age, gender, and education.},

  abstract = {The attitude?behavior relationship is of great import to many areas of psychology. Indeed, psychologists across disciplines have published thousands of articles on the topic. The majority of this research implies that the attitude?behavior relationship is linear. However, observations from 4,101 participants on Amazon?s Mechanical Turk and 321,876 online reviews demonstrate that this relationship is systematically nonlinear. Across diverse topics, measures, and contexts, as attitudes move from extremely negative to extremely positive, the corresponding shift in behavior tends to be relatively flat at first (as attitudes move from extremely to moderately negative), to steepen when attitudes cross neutral and shift from negative to positive, and to taper off again as attitudes move from moderately to extremely positive. This result can be explained on the basis of research on categorical perception. The present research suggests a fundamental pivot in how researchers construe, study, and assess the attitude?behavior relationship.},

Recently, a new concept has been introduced to gauge populism among voters and to explain voting for populist parties: populist attitudes. However, some researchers regard populist attitudes as simply another measurement of existing and established concepts such as political trust and external political efficacy. Using data from the Netherlands (2018), this article addresses the relationship between these concepts, both theoretically and empirically. This article examines whether political trust, external political efficacy, and populist attitudes tap into different latent dimensions. Using a confirmatory factor analysis, we show that populist attitudes are not old wine in new bottles and that they tap into different underlying attitudes than political trust and external political efficacy. Furthermore, we show that the three measures are not only different constructs but also relate differently to populist voting preferences.},

High levels of political efficacy could further be regarded as a glue that keeps a political community together and should be even more important within minority communities. As political efficacy differs across minority communities, it indicates that individual levels of political efficacy is not only an individual trait but something also affected by the local contextual features. To explore the relationship between varying local contexts and political efficacy within a minority population, we use data from Barometern 2019 (N = 3,913), which is a survey measuring the opinions and attitudes of the Swedish-speaking population in Finland, i.e., the Swedish-speaking Finns. This study, thus, analyses the role of contextual- and individual-level determinants (e.g., age, education and gender) as well as linguistic identity (Swedish and bilingual) and political interest on both internal (subjective sense of political understanding) and external (political responsiveness) political efficacy. We find that context matters for political efficacy within a minority context but that the effects differ between the internal and external types of political efficacy. The findings presented will contribute to increasing our knowledge about political efficacy within a minority context.},

We examine how the expectation that the Bersih movement would be successful in reaching its aims has been related to the development of a sense of individual political efficacy \textendash{} the belief that people can influence the electoral process by exercising their political rights. We draw on findings from two longitudinal surveys conducted with a convenience sample of Malaysians before and after two critical events: the Bersih 5 protests in 2016, and the 14th General Election (GE14) in 2018, which saw the fall of the Barisan Nasional regime after six decades of unbroken rule. Using this data, we argue that the expectation that Bersih would be successful has been important in shaping people's perceptions of their own political efficacy. An increased sense of political efficacy was especially apparent among Chinese and Indian minorities, compared to the Malay majority, although all three groups reported higher levels of political efficacy after Bersih 5 and GE14. These findings reflect the rise in rights consciousness, and we discuss its importance in understanding Bersih's role in shaping democratic transition, in Malaysia.},

IPE refers to subjective competence to understand politics and make informed choices. IPE is important because it has a strong positive association with many forms of political participation and also enhances the legitimacy of democratic regimes. Consequently, IPE forms part of the foundations of political equality. Using data from the Czech Republic and insights from personal information, social resource and social learning models (SLMs), this study shows that variation in youth IPE is most strongly linked with discussions among family, friends and classmates. In contrast to previous work, open classroom climate was not found to have a positive link with IPE, and Campbell's (2008, Political Behavior 30(4): 437\textendash 54) compensation hypothesis could not be accepted.},

High-level income inequality can have consequences for people's subjective beliefs about their ability to participate in politics effectively, a concept known as political efficacy. In this research, we explore how individuals' perceptions of income inequality are related to their sense of political efficacy. While previous studies on political outcomes of income inequality have focused on objective, country-level inequality indicators, we focus on subjective perception\textemdash how individuals' perceptions of distributive fairness are related to political efficacy. Drawing on data from the fourth wave of the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS) (2014\,\textasciitilde\,2016), we show that the perception of unfair income distribution negatively affects political efficacy. We posit a mediator in the association, namely the individual's preference for government's redistributive role, as a linking mechanism between the perception of income inequality and political efficacy. Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian multilevel model, we also present how country-level variation in income inequality exerts a moderating effect on the association. Our findings suggest that political efficacy is partially linked to how people perceive (un)fair income distribution and subsequent expectations of the government's role in redistribution.},

Based on Social Cognitive theory this study propounds the concepts of online political self- and collective efficacy and explores their relationship to online collective political activism. Findings of a survey of members of three activist groups of a US Mid-Western university (n = 222) suggest that a correspondence exists between efficacy perceptions and the level of agency at which the political activities are performed online.
