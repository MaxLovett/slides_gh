* Scenario I: Shuffle Response

> Earlier this month, a downstairs neighbor continually made loud noises in the apartment beneath the one in which one of your classmates lives. It had a serious effect on people's lives there. To resolve this issue, the parent of your classmate called the public service hotline. The call was first transferred to the .magenta[City Department of Property Management] and then to the .magenta[Municipal Construction Committee]. Public servants responded to the call in the following recording.

假设你一个同学家楼下是底商。本月初发现楼底下有极大的噪音，请专人测量确实噪音已经超出了规定范围。调查发现底商中央空调的压缩机产生的。为了解决这个问题，这位同学的家长打电话给12345市民服务热线，先后被转到物管办和住建委。录音记录了他们的回应。

## Measurement of General Trust

Trust game:

* Strength: Abstract trust $\rightarrow$ money decision
* Process: Subjects have ten golden coins
    + Play with the speaker
    + 1-coin investment from subject = 3-coin profits of speaker
    + Speaker decides how much to return
    + Goal: maximize the own coins

## Measurement of Content Authenticity

* Authenticity: Do you believe what the speaker said?
     + e.g., "*Given there is one department in the recording actually responsible to the complaint, which department do you think it is, City Department of Property Management or Municipal Construction Committee?*"

* 421 high school students
