## Puzzle 2: Migration Decision Making

.center[<img src="images/migrantFamily.jpg" height = 300 width = 500 />]

Migration is a family decision.

+ Family movement or one-person adventure
+ W. or w.o. children

???

Children cannot access the local schools. Partners are not easy to get job.

Staying rurally could be also beneficial (Chan and Buckingham, 2008)

In more urbanized settings such as Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta, people may prefer to keep their rural hukou status so they can continue to enjoy various rural benefits such as extra birth allowance while living in urban settings.

## An Examination of the Benefit Effect

Hukou .large[&#10144;] migration decisions (unconsciously?)

Situational experiment:

> Assuming you have a plan to leave from the city your hukou was registered, there are two available options: City A and B. The two cities are very similar. Both are in economically developed areas and have similar distances to your hukou city. You don’t have any social relations in either of them. The difference is that .blue[you expect to earn twice as much in City A as in City B, while the average living cost in A is also about 1. 5 times of the cost in B]. .red[Also, it is easier to obtain a local hukou in City B than in A.] Given these conditions, where do you prefer to move, A or B?

Tend to moving A or B (Likert scale)

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, comparing the distributive differences

.center[<img src="images/benefitAccess.png" height = 600 width = 1000 />]

???

The benefit stimulus shows more effect

---

## Confirmation from the Representative Sample

.center[<img src="images/easyAccessObserved.png" height = 550 width = 600 />]

???

Hukou is negative in terms of staying in the destination 

The effect does not differ across different level of destinations

---

## Confirmation of the Mechanism

.pull-left[
A value-perspective of Hukou strictness:

+ Absolutely high value &harr; high restriction
+ Relatively high value &harr; high.red[er] restriction

# Conclusion and Discussion

---

## What We've Learned


1. Hukou as a ~~barrier~~
    + People don't (intentionally) care about hukou when making the migration decision.

1. Hukou as a benefit
    + Hukou alters people's migration decision with a *benefit-based* mechanism

---

## Implications

1. Policy does drive migration flows beyond the economic benefit, and we partially  know how. 
1. Appealing = More public goods > Released hukou
