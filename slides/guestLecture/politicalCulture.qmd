:::{.notes}
Middle English (denoting a cultivated piece of land)

The noun from French culture or directly from Latin cultura ‘growing, cultivation’; 
The verb from obsolete French culturer or medieval Latin culturare, both based on Latin colere ‘tend, cultivate’ (see cultivate). 

In late Middle English the sense was ‘cultivation of the soil’ and from this (early 16th century), arose ‘cultivation (of the mind, faculties, or manners’); culture (sense 1 of the noun) dates from the early 19th century.

> 《彖》曰：柔来而文刚，故亨。分，刚上而文柔。故以小利有攸往。刚柔交错，天文也；文明以止，人文也。**观乎天文，以察时变，观乎人文，以化成天下**。


:::{.notes}
彖 tuan4

贲。艮山+离火, 亨。小利有攸（you1）往。

象辞，是周文王和周公引用商代《坤乾易》（象辞易）做为佐证的部分辞句，主要从卦象来阐释社会伦理道德意义。《彖传》和《象传》二者的共同点是：通过阐释卦象、爻象所蕴涵的道理，告知人们如何正确决定自己的行动。

易传“十翼”之二的象传：

《象》曰：山下有火，贲。先王以明庶政，无敢折狱。

《象辞》说：本卦上卦为艮为山，下卦为离为火，山下有火，火燎群山，这是贲卦的卦象。君子观此卦象，思及猛火燎山，玉石俱焚，草木皆尽，以此为戒，从而明察各项政事，不敢以威猛断狱。

## Civic Culture: Theoretical Perspective

TL;DR: 

1. Regime is determined by people's attitudes;
1. Too much participation, allegiance, nor detachment helps democracy;
1. Democratic cultures in Germany, Italy, Mexico, Great Britain, and the U.S. 
    - The U.S. is the "best."

TL;DR:

1. Socioeconomic development (probablistically) brings secularism and self-expression.

2. No global cultural convergence in sight.

3. Cultural change is a non-linear process

4. Modernization not the same as Westernization.
:::

::::

:::{.notes}
1. Socioeconomic development, in probabilistic terms, ‘tends to make people more secular, tolerant, and trusting and to place more emphasis on self-expression, participation, and the quality of life’.

2. No global cultural convergence in sight---religion and other traditions not disappearing.

3. Cultural modernization is reversible, e.g. post-socialist Europe.

4. Cultural change is a non-linear process. Post-industrialization moves on from industrialization’s processes of rationalizaton, centralization and bureaucratization towards ever more stress on self-expression and individual autonomy.

5. Modernization not the same as Westernization. USA not a typical example of cultural change, indeed an anomaly in its religious and traditional values.

6. Rise of self-expression values giving rise to ‘a new type of humanistic society that promotes human emancipation’, e.g. gays, women, the disabled.  Centrality of cultural change to emergence and maintenance of democracy has been downplayed in previous theories.

## Theoretical Components and Logic

:::{.r-hstack}
![](images/pc_values.png){.fragment height=600}

![](images/pc_modernization.png){.fragment height=700}
:::

:::{.notes}
Traditional values emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide. These societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook.

Secular-rational values have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable. (Suicide is not necessarily more common.)

Survival values place emphasis on economic and physical security. It is linked with a relatively ethnocentric outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance.

Self-expression values give high priority to environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, and rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life.

### Solution

Rubric, sharedness, or societal-level 
:::


:::{.notes}
+ (1) how to define the concept; 
+ (2) how to disentangle subcultures (for example an elite political culture) from a society's overall political culture; 
+ (3) how to integrate the many individual-level orientations of which the concept is composed; 
+ (4) how to create a societal-level variable from individual-level components; 
+ (5) if the foregoing have been resolved, how to measure the concept; 
+ (6) how to derive hypotheses about individual political behavior from the subjective orientations under study; 
+ (7) how political culture interacts with institutions and other attributes of a polity to produce a propensity for certain types of political outcomes.

Pye 1965: Institution history shapes the mass culture

Almond and Power 1992: Culture is a medium for inputs and outputs

+ Rubric: Agree we are talking about different things
+ Sharedness: only looking at the same part across societies
+ Societal-level: social attributes, but the ability to connect individual and environment lost

## Challenge of Civic-Culture Theory: Operation

*Individual &rarr; society, how?*

+ Complexity
+ Individual fallacy

### Way-Out

> A theoretical rationale for why a particular way of summarizing a large number of individual responses is culture. --- William Reisinger (1995)
:::


:::{.notes}
+ Mechanism (cognitive process between brain and information)
+ Complexity (complex construct for a single individual across the society)
+ Individual fallacy (deriving aggregation conclusion from individuals, the set, pattern, system of--- meaningless); Culturalists derided scholars arguing about national character but doing similar things
