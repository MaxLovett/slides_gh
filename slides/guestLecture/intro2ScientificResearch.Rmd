# Preface

---

## Who am I?

* Dr. Hu, PhD. of political science at University of Iowa
* A Comparativist (political linguistics, political culture, identity)
* A Methodologist (experiment, text analysis, etc.)

--

* A nerd.

## What Shall We Discuss?

How to conduct a political scientific research?

* Two parts:
    + Strategy
    + Design

--

* Goals:
    + Informational: not very much.
    + Practical: Yeah! (How?)

---

# Two Examples

Solt, Frederick, Yue Hu, Hudson Kevan, Jungmin Song, Dong Yu. 2017a. “Economic Inequality and Belief in Meritocracy in the United States.” *Research & Politics* 3(4): 1–7.

———. 2017b. “Economic Inequality and Class Consciousness.” *The Journal of Politics* 79(3): 1079–83.

# Strategy

---

## What's My Topic?

* (Income) Inequality

--

* Where does this come from? (For a student)

--

Some deep thoughts? .red[Nope.]

--

Some personal experience? .red[Nope.]

--

Movie, TV, music? 

.red[Probably, but not for this time---and most of the time.]

---

## How about...

* Old term paper, e.g., Solt et al. 2017a.
* Others' paper, e.g., Solt et al. 2017b.

---

## Question, Question...

* What's a good question? (KKV 1994)
    + Important
    + Potentially failed
    + Ignored or misunderstood

---

## Practical Rules

* Powerful
    + Curious
    + General
    + Falsified
    
--
    
* Attractive
    + Mind-blowing
    + Simple
    + Punchy

---

## Like Them

--

.center[<img src="image/deadpool.webp" height = 250 />]

---

## Solt et al. 2017a

* Meritocracy and Inequality

--

.center[<img src="image/zootopia.gif" height = 300 />]

---

Low-income group * Income inequality &rarr; Meritocracy

--

* Poor vs. Rich
* Social Structure: Self-reproducing vs. self-negating

???

Self-reproducing: relative power theory
Self-negating: conflict theory

---

## Solt et al. 2017b

Low-income group &times; Income inequality &rarr; Class consciousness

--

* The poor
    + Wake-up or ......
    
---

## Where Are You, My Research Question?

* Literature

--

* .magenta[Chat]
    + Office hour
    + Peers
    
---

## Theory

.left-column[Or myth?]

--

.right-column[<img src="image/currencyWars.jpg" height = 500 />]

---

## What's a Theory?

Something like this? 

--

.center[<img src="image/socialNetworkTheory.gif" height = 450 />]


---

## A Good Theory

* Not have to be complicate
* Not have to be detailed
* Not have to be static

---

## Principles 

* Scientific (Popper 1968)
    + Consistent
    + Falsifiable
    
--

* Valid
    + Unit of Analysis
    + Causal inference
    
--

* General
    + General terms
    + Avoid stretching
    
---

## Example: Solt et al. 2016

Conflict Theory

.center[<img src="image/hulk.gif" height = 400 />]

---

Experience (e.g., exposure to inequality) 

&rarr; awakening 

&rarr; fight for redistribution

---

Relative Power Theory

.center[<img src="image/hypnosis.gif" height = 400 />]

--

Money = source &rarr; The rich shape the poor.

---

## A Causal Theory

* Rule of building a causal theory (KKV 1994)
    + Falsifiable
    + Consistent
    + Variance in the dependent variable
    + Concrete
    + Feasible
    
    
---

## Theoretical &rarr; Observable

Hypotheses + Measurements

---

## Hypotheses 

* Logical rather than descriptive or normative statement

--

* Clear relationship

--

* Small set

--

Hint: Be straightforward.

---

## Example:

* Solt et al. 2017a: Poor people living with high inequality believe in meritocracy less (conflict theory).

* Solt et al. 2017b: Poor people living with high inequality regard themselves more as "have-not."

---

## Measurement

* Internal Validity
    + Construct validity
    + Causal validity
    + Statistical validity
    
--

* External Validity
    + Scientific replication
    
--

* Ecological Validity

--

* Coding rule: unbiased and efficient

---

## Example: Inequality

.left-column[
* Income
    + Census
    + Self-report
    ]
    
--

.right-column[

* Gini coefficient [0-1]
    + Gini index [1-100]
    
.center[<img src="image/gini.gif" height = 300 />]
]

???
Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912,

Lorenz curve (accumulate from poor to rich, how much % of the wealth increases when the income of one more household is added)

0.4 is the red line

国家统计局长马建堂（现国务院发展研究中心副主任）说，“我们认真研究评估，感觉到靠我们现在的城镇住户调查而计算出来的城镇居民收入的基尼系数偏低，所以就没有发布。”偏低的原因主要是“难以获取高收入阶层居民真实的收入信息”。

---

## (Negative) Example

Newman, Johnston, and Lown (2015)

Pew data
* 2005-06:
    1. "Most people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard." 
    1. "Hard work and determination are no guarantee of success for most people."

???

Choosing 2 were coded as rejecting meritocracy. 

---

* 2007: four-point agree-disagree
    1. "Hard work offers little guarantee of success."
    1. "Success in life is pretty much determined by forces outside our control."

???

Those who mostly or completely agreed with both statements were coded as rejecting meritocracy.

--

+ 2009: four-point agree-disagree
    + "Hard work offers little guarantee of success."
    
???

Those who mostly or completely agreed with statement (1) were coded as rejecting meritocracy regardless of how they responded to statement (2)

---

## Problem

1. Not all available data
1. Selected method.

---

# Design

---

## Where Does the Data Come from?

* Case: 
    + Governmental archives
    + Academic paper
    + Internet
* Survey
* Statistical data

---

## Example: GINI coefficient

Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID)

--

Frederick Solt, Associate Professor of Political Science at University of Iowa

.center[<img src="image/Solt.jpg" height = 300 />]

---

## SWIID

The best cross-national Gini data around the world.

--

Base model: Luxembourg Income Study

--

Yearly updated

--

Website: http://fsolt.org/swiid/

---

## What Design Should I Use?

* Classic paradigm: Theory-driven

--

+ "Quantitative" vs. "Qualitative"
+ Small-N vs. Large-N

--

* Process
    + Build up from a simple model
    + Select method based on the nature of data
    + Add necessary controls
    + Space and time

---

## Example: Solt et al. 2017a

Hypothesis: Poor people living with high inequality believe in meritocracy less.

--

Model:

$$\begin{align}
Reject\ Meritocracy_{ij} =& \boldsymbol{Controls\gamma} \\
                          & + \gamma_{10}Income_{ij} + \gamma_{01}Inequality_j \\ & + \gamma_{11}Inequality_j\times Income_{ij} \\
                          & + u_{ij}
\end{align}$$

---

## Why Interaction?

How to interpret it?

--

$\gamma_{10}$? $\gamma_{01}$? $\gamma_{11}$?

--

.red[No, no, and no!]

--

### Correct way

Marginal Effect

$$\frac{\partial Reject\ Meritocracy}{\partial Inequality} = \gamma_{01} + \gamma_{11}Income_{ij}.$$

---

## Challenge from Big Data

* Classic paradigm: Theory-driven

--

* Emerging paradigm: Data-driven

---

## What's Big Data?

A 2016 definition: 

"Data sets characterized by huge amounts of frequently updated data in various formats, such as numeric, textual, or images/videos." (Kaplan & Haenlein 2019)

--

Volumn &times; Velocity &times; Variety

---

## Why Not Focusing on Big Data Today?

* Classic paradigm is still strong
* Not one lecture can cover
* Basic logics are compatible

## Take-Home Points (Check List)

1. Do I have a good question?
1. Do I have a developed theory?
1. Do I have a set of causal hypotheses?
1. Do I select appropriate measurements?
1. Is my data source legit?
1. Is my method legit?
1. Do I present the results in the most efficient way?
1. .magenta[Don't forget to chat with your adviser, faculty members, and colleagues!]

# Bonus: Some Tips for Small-N Fellows

---

## How Can I Be a "Qualitative" Social Scientist?

Equivalently complex (if not more)!

--

Be scientific! (see Przeworski and Teune 1970)

--

Design and methods (process tracing, thick description, case comparison......).

--

Incorporate numbers!

--

Visualize your data! (AtLas.ti, NVivo, Quirkos, etc.)
