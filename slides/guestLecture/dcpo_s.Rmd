Why are there mixed results? 
Difficutlies in measuring. 
First, pub sp is latent variable, unobservable. Uncertainty. 
Sec, a big challenge is the sparced and fragmented data at aggregate level. 
churchihill items,  democracy has its probles, still the best one.

---

## IRT

Why not factor analyses?

--

1. The outcome is assumed .red[continual];
1. Different types (categorical, binary, ordinal, continual) of indicators are assumed .red[identical] in nature;
1. Ignoring .red[cross-group] differences;
1. EFA cannot address the .red[covariance] among indicators;
1. CFA: Simpler theory or .red[low-fit] model.

???

CFA理论通常简略，只涉及一部分indices，但实际可能很复杂；当囊括更多indices测量质量会高，但不符合理论。

## Why IRT


1. Created for .red[noncontinuous] variables (binary &rarr; ordinal + continuous);

--

1. Open to incorporate with .red[Bayesian] inference and no .red[scaling] issue;

--

1. Better dealing with .red["don't know"s] within the Bayesian framework

--

1. Being Enable .red[cross-group] comparison.

---

## Individual-Level IRT

Usage: Within-survey latent variable analysis

Objective:

1. Yes/No;
1. Responses that can convert to binary;
3. Ordinal responses(e.g., Liker scale questions).

## An Simple Example (Bock & Lieberman 1970)

summary(df_lsat) %>% kable(format = "html")
```

## Difficulty Parameter

```{r rasch-difficulty, echo=TRUE}
m_lsat <- mirt(df_lsat, model = 1, itemtype = "Rasch", verbose = FALSE)
coef(m_lsat, simplify = TRUE) %>% 
  kable(format = "html")
```

???

The difficulty parameter is the `d`

The rest parameters we'll talk in 2pl and 3pl

# Group IRT

## Finding the Group-Level Latent Variables

Group mean of individual responses

.center[y<sub>kq</sub> = &Sigma;y<sub>ikq</sub> &frasl; n.]

--

Aggregation Issues:

1. The mean does not have much substantial influence to the result if the group `k` is too small.
1. Different `y`s have different contributions to the latent variable.

???

问题：

1. 如果群组过小，其平均值的代表意义不大
2. 不同的指标对于潜在变量贡献不一样

---

## Getting the Group Mean Right

Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification (MrP)

.red[Predict] a parameter of interest within .red[small domains] through .red[modeling the mean] of the variable of interest .red[conditional on poststratification counts].

*Example*

Source: Economic variables of 2,396 industrial companies in a particular year

Goal: Average income of industries by .red[each of the five existing zones](&theta;<sub>1~5</sub>). 

Company levels and zones (the population, "company census")

```{r descriptive-level}

  kable(format = "html")
```

???

---

Fortunately, we know the .red[true] averages at this time.


```{r trueMean}
tb_true <- group_by(Lucy, Zone) %>% 
  summarise(income = mean(Income) )
tb_true %>% 
  kable(format = "html", digits = 2)
```

---

A random sample of 1,000 from the population (2,396)

```{r rawVsTrue, fig.cap="Sample Means vs. True Means", fig.align='center', , out.height="95%"}
SLucy <- sample_n(Lucy, size = 1000)
Np <- table(Lucy$Level, Lucy$Zone)


tb_compare <- group_by(SLucy, Zone) %>%
  summarise(income = mean(Income)) %>%
  left_join(tb_true, by = c("Zone")) %>%
  mutate(incomeTrue = 0,
         rawDiff = income.x - income.y, )

ggplot(tb_compare, aes(x = incomeTrue, xend = rawDiff, y = Zone)) +
  geom_dumbbell(
    size = 4,
    size_x = 8,

    colour_x = gb_cols("red"),
    colour_xend = gb_cols("black"),

## Comparision

```{r mrpVsraw, out.height="100%", fig.align='center'}
# Step 1: <<MR>> - Multilevel regression
M1 <- lmer(Income ~ Level + (1 | Zone), data = SLucy)
SLucy$Pred <- predict(M1)

Mupred <- matrix(sum$mean2, ncol = 5, nrow = 3)

rownames(Mupred) <- levels(SLucy$Level)
colnames(Mupred) <- levels(SLucy$Zone)

# Mupred %>% kable(format = "html", digits = 2)

# Step 2: <<Post-stratification>>
# Mean income estimation per zone
tb_compare$mrpDiff <-
  colSums(Np * Mupred) / count(Lucy, Zone)$n - tb_compare$income.y
tb_compare <- rename(tb_compare,
                     Raw = rawDiff,
                     MrP = mrpDiff)
