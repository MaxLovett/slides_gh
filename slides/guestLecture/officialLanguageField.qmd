查理曼大帝 /shaar·luh·maynia/：to have a second language is to have a second soul

论语·子路：名不正，则言不顺；*言不顺，则事不成；事不成，则礼乐不兴*；礼乐不兴，则刑罚不中；刑罚不中，则民无所措手足。故君子名之必可言也，言之必可行也。*君子于其言，无所苟而已矣*。

汉·扬雄《法言·问神》：“故言，心声也；书，心画也。声画形，君子小人见矣……故言，心声也。书，心画也。声画形，君子小人见矣！声画者，君子小人之所以动情乎！”

:::{.notes}
Lera Boro/dit/sky (born c.1976) is a cognitive scientist and professor in the fields of language and cognition. She is one of the main contributors to the theory of linguistic relativity.[2] She is a Searle Scholar, a McDonnell Scholar, recipient of a National Science Foundation Career award, and an American Psychological Association Distinguished Scientist.[3] She is Professor of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. She previously served on the faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Stanford.

## Example: Gender

![](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/speak_linguisticRelativity_gender.png){fig-align="center" height=600}

:::{.notes}
German and spanish have different gender in language about e.g., sun and moon.

Bridge in German is feminine, so using adj. like beautiful, elegant, while the term is masculine in Spanish, so using adj. like strong and long

## Example: Event

![](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/speak_linguisticRelativity_event.png){fig-align="center" height=600}

:::{.notes}
In English, "he broke the vase." The subject is emphasized. In other language, you can only say "the vase is broken"---the event is emphasized.

In English, you can say "I broke my arm" but not in other language, like Spanish unless you intentionally do it. So the former speaker remember (and thus blame) the subject of an event better while the latter remember the event content better

:::{.notes}
The ethnolinguistic theory's integral view hinders the exploration of how different language functions---such as listening, speaking, and understanding---uniquely influence political cognition and preferences. 
The empirical findings in this chapter reveal distinct effects, underscoring the need for an alternative theoretical approach to explain these observations and fill the gaps left by the ethnolinguistic perspective.

## Official Language Field Theory^[Official language: [Practical]{.red} language by the central government and its agents]

- Official vs. non-official &rarr; "voice of the state" + nationally communicational language &rarr; Official language field (OLF)

![](https://drhuyue.site:10002/sammo3182/figure/speak_olf.png){.fragment fig-align="center" height=460}

## Comparison

|            | Ethnolinguistic Theory      | OLF                      |
|------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Source**      | Exogeneous            | Endogeneous              |
| **Size**        | Fixed                 | Improvable by learning   |
| **Direction**   | Integrated            | Functionally divergent   |

:::{.Small}
- > $H_1$: In an official language field, citizens with [higher listening]{.red} proficiency in the official language are likely to possess [more accurate]{.red} political knowledge about the established government and exhibit a [greater willingness]{.red} to maintain alignment with it. Consequently, they tend to hold [higher]{.red} levels of political trust.
- > $H_2$: In an official language field, citizens with [greater speaking]{.red} proficiency in the official language are more likely to have [higher internal]{.red} political efficacy and [lower external]{.blue} efficacy. Both lead to [lower]{.blue} political trust.
- > $H_3$: In an official language field, citizens with [higher relative]{.red} proficiency in the official language experience [greater]{.red} social satisfaction and have a [more positive]{.red} perception of society; their trust in the government is also likely to be [higher]{.red}.

## Research Design

- Source: CGSS 2010--2015
- EV 
    - Listening &rarr; Exposure effect
    - Speaking &rarr; Expression effect
    - Relative &rarr; Competitive effect
      - $$\Delta_{s_{ik}} = s_{ik} - \bar{s}_k,$$ where $s_{ik}$ represents an individual's speaking proficiency in prefecture $k$, and $\bar{s}_k$ is the average speaking proficiency in that prefecture. 

## Outcome

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Exposure: 
    1. Speaker of the National People's Congress
    1. Compliance with the rules
    1. Policy attitudes: Laissez-faire birth; domestic migration
- Expression:
    1. Internal efficacy
    1. External efficacy

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Competition:
    1. Horizontal gratification
    1. Vertical gratification
    1. Perceptive social fairness
- Political trust:
    1. Central/legislature
    1. Local

## Modeling Strategy

- Three functions' horse racing
- Control: education, age, ethnic identity, gender, family income, party membership, media habits, occpuation types
- Multilevel modeling at the provincial level + cross-wave fixed effect


## Results: Exposure

## Results: Expression

## Results: Trust

## Conclusion and Implication

- OLF is empirically supported
- Linguistic relativity is [neither inherent nor immutable]{.red}
- Cognitive effect is [complex]{.red}
- [Role]{.red} of language policy and language learning
- Language planning and [modernization]{.red}

:::{.notes}
- English speaker: left to right
- Hebrew/arabic: right to left
- Kuuk Thaayorre (Aboriginal community in Australia): they do not have "left," "right" in language, so they will order them always east to right:
    - Facing south: left to right
    - Facing north: right to left
    - Facing east: Towards to the body

Russian have two words for blue. When looking at the brain activity, color changing from dark to light stimuli a surprising shock.

Similarly for 煎炒烹炸, 平底鍋煎魚時用pan-fry，炒菜用stir-fry，油炸是deep-fry。
