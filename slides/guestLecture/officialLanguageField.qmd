## TL;DR

**Objective**: linguistic relativity in mass political minds

**Theory**:  Ethnolinguistic vs. [Official Language Field]{.red}

**Method**: Two-step analysis based on 5-yr nationally representative surveys in China

**Finding**: 

::: {.nonincremental}
1. *Language* is [not]{.red} merely an identity proxy: official language shapes public political cognition and attitudes via distinctive functional paths.
1. *Language effect* is [not]{.red} exogeneous: language learning and applied environment matter.
1. *Policy-conditioned language effect* is [not]{.red} unidirectional: Being in favor of the incumbent + promoting autonomy
:::

**Implication**: Understandign of linguistic relativity, role of language policy, language plan and sociopolitical modernization

查理曼大帝 /shaar·luh·maynia/：to have a second language is to have a second soul

论语·子路：名不正，则言不顺；*言不顺，则事不成；事不成，则礼乐不兴*；礼乐不兴，则刑罚不中；刑罚不中，则民无所措手足。故君子名之必可言也，言之必可行也。*君子于其言，无所苟而已矣*。

汉·扬雄《法言·问神》：“故言，心声也；书，心画也。声画形，君子小人见矣……故言，心声也。书，心画也。声画形，君子小人见矣！声画者，君子小人之所以动情乎！”

Lera Boro/dit/sky (born c.1976) is a cognitive scientist and professor in the fields of language and cognition. She is one of the main contributors to the theory of linguistic relativity.[2] She is a Searle Scholar, a McDonnell Scholar, recipient of a National Science Foundation Career award, and an American Psychological Association Distinguished Scientist.[3] She is Professor of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. She previously served on the faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Stanford.

- Gender: German and spanish have different gender in language about e.g., sun and moon. Bridge in German is feminine, so using adj. like beautiful, elegant, while the term is masculine in Spanish, so using adj. like strong and long

- Subject: In English, "he broke the vase." The subject is emphasized. In other language, you can only say "the vase is broken"---the event is emphasized. In English, you can say "I broke my arm" but not in other language, like Spanish unless you intentionally do it. So the former speaker remember (and thus blame) the subject of an event better while the latter remember the event content better

Consequently, they tend to hold [higher]{.red} levels of political trust.
- > $H_2$: In an official language field, citizens with [greater speaking]{.red} proficiency in the official language are more likely to have [higher internal]{.red} political efficacy and [lower external]{.blue} efficacy. Both lead to [lower]{.blue} political trust.

- EV 
    - Listening &rarr; Exposure effect
    - Speaking &rarr; Expression effect
    - Relative &rarr; Competitive effect
      - $$\Delta_{s_{ik}} = s_{ik} - \bar{s}_k,$$ where $s_{ik}$ represents an individual's speaking proficiency in prefecture $k$, and $\bar{s}_k$ is the average speaking proficiency in that prefecture. 

## Outcome

- Exposure:

        - domestic migration ([-]{.red})
- Expression:

## Modeling Strategy

- Three functions' horse racing
- Control: education, age, ethnic identity, gender, family income, party membership, media habits, occpuation types
- Multilevel modeling at the provincial level + cross-wave fixed effect


## Results: Exposure

## Conclusion and Implication

OLF is empirically supported

- Cognitive effect is [complex]{.red}

Implications:

- [Role]{.red} of language policy and language learning
- Language planning and [modernization]{.red}

- English speaker: left to right
- Hebrew/arabic: right to left
- Kuuk Thaayorre (Aboriginal community in Australia): they do not have "left," "right" in language, so they will order them always east to right:
    - Facing south: left to right
    - Facing north: right to left
    - Facing east: Towards to the body
