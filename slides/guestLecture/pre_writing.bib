Peer review is one of the most important and basic tools for science worth communicating. Currently it seems to be in a crisis, and as a journal editor, I question why, and call for re-allocating time for this important function in academia.},

  abstract = {Object. Informal education based on public facilities, such as museums and memorials, is an important propaganda practice in authoritarian countries. However, the empirical research on this area is underdeveloped and relies on small and potentially biased samples. Method. This study collects unique spatial-opinion data of over 300 such informal education facilities in China merged with original survey data and conducts a systematic evaluation of this form of propaganda. Result. The statistical results challenge the conventional expectation that more exposure to the informal education facilities would improve the citizens' support and obedience to the government. Conclusion. The findings reveal a backfire effect of informal education facilities that more exposure to them reduces both citizens' political support and obedience.},

  abstract = {Background: As a highly contagious disease, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a serious health threat and psychological burden for the global communities. From the conceptual perspective of affordances, this research examined the role of social media for health campaign and psychological support during the global crisis. Methods: Data from both social media and a nationwide survey were collected and analyzed. Face-mask-related posts on Sina Weibo from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2020 were retrieved and studied. Face mask wearing as a well-established preventive measure was identified and examined from hashtag topics. A nationwide survey with a randomized experiment embedded was conducted to further investigate the mobilizing dynamics. Results: During the escalation phase in the first half 2020, the hashtag topic ``\#national mask campaign\#'', initiated by a celebrity, topped the ranking of mask-related topics on Weibo. The findings indicated that prevention activities, solidarity expression and names of celebrity idols were frequently discussed. With celebrity idols as opinion leaders, millions of fandom publics actively participated in this hashtag health campaign. Results of the nationwide survey show the popularity of fan identity, and the experiment results demonstrate strong mobilizing power of celebrity idol and fandom community in civic engagement and participation among young Chinese. Conclusions: The research demonstrates how the affordances of social media, such as liking, commenting, reposting, and hashtagging, can be influential in promoting health behaviors and expressing solidarity. Implications for public health professionals and policy makers to raise awareness and understanding about health campaign via social media are discussed.},
