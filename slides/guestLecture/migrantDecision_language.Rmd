# Language Barrier

## Potential Explanations

Language as ....

.center[<img src = "../courses/teachingDemo/image/speakChinese.gif">]
]

???

a tool of communication

low proficiency in the vernacular, more difficulty

--

.pull-right[
.center[<img src = "../courses/teachingDemo/image/ce.jpg" height = 320>]
]

???

an identity maker

Chen, Zhao, Ming Lu, and Le Xu. 2014. “Returns to Dialect: Identity Exposure Through Language in the Chinese Labor Market.” China Economic Review 30: 27–43.


For instance, in a study of Shanghai, one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the country, Chen et al 2014 show that migrants who can use Shanghainese, the local dialect, usually get higher paying and public-facing jobs than those who cannot. 

Given the high rate of Putonghua comprehension in the city, the issue of Shanghainese is about identity rather than communication.

## Hypothesis and Examination

H<sub>1</sub>: When migrants determent where to migrate or whether to remain where they are, they prefer the place with a .red[weaker] language barrier

--

- Data: 
    - China Labor Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS 2016)
        - Nationally representative, > 2000 migrants
    - Living Environment Satisfaction Survey of Chinese Residents (LESS 2018)
        - Online quota, 50:50 migrants:nonmigrants
        
???

The survey was issued through Qualtrics, a professional data company, during October and September of 2018.

---

## Language Choice

<img src = "images/language-distribution-1.png">

???

Native that is different from the vernacular

Working time: residents vernacular, migrants putonghua
Off-work: vernacular dominated

Putonghua replaces vernacular? 
Liang, Language Attitudes and Identities in Multilingual China; Wu and Yang, “Language Options and Changes of Home-returning Migrant Population: Quantitative Analysis Based on Communication Space”.

Probably not

## Migrant's Will

> Do you want to remain in the current location? (1--5, CLDS 2016)

.center[Explanatory variable]

- Language closeness
    - Language-tree (Language Atlas of China 2015)
    - Dialect points < clusters < subgroups < groups < super groups     
    (Available in the [`regioncode`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=regioncode ) package)

    - Self report

## Results

???

Closeness is natural advantage
Vernacular proficiency is effort and in general

Both indicate the language barrier

Language is far more unique than a proxy of education or geo distance and one of the most influential factor


---

## Staying &ne; Going

Situational experiment in LESS 2018:

> Assuming you have a plan to leave from the city your hukou was registered, there are two available options: City A and B. The two cities are very similar. Both are in .blue[economically developed areas] and located at .blue[similar distances] to your hukou city. You don’t have any social relations to either of them. The difference is that you are expected to .blue[earn twice] as much in City A as in City B, while the .blue[average living cost] in A is also about 1. 5 times of the cost in B. Given these conditions, where do you prefer to move, A or B?

--

Treatment:

> The vernacular in City B is .red[**quite similar**] to your mother tongue. You can make smooth communication there with no problem, while the vernacular of City A is very different from yours.

# What Can Govenrment Do

---

## Can Language Policy Reducing Language Barriers

How?

Language policy/planning: Setting up the national communal language (NCL) and its relationship with other linguistic types.

--

Some facts of NCL in China

- Standard Putonghua didn't exist until the 1950s
- Putonghua coverage: [80.72% in 2021](http://www.moe.gov.cn/jyb_xwfb/xw_zt/moe_357/jyzt_2020n/2020_zt23/baodao/202009/t20200915_488008.html) 

--

- NCL brings higher income and better job (Dovì, Gao, Fu)
- NCL brings ethnic equality (Tang, Hu & Jin 2017)
- Vernaculars still matter (Wang and Fan, Gong, Chow & Ahstrom, Wang et al.)

## Hypothesis and Examinations

H<sub>2.1</sub> (Harmonizing): Proficiency in the NCL (e.g, Putonghua) .red[reduces] the influence of vernacular language abilities on migration decision making.

--

- H<sub>2.1a</sub> Migrants with higher Putonghua proficiency are .red[more likely] to migrate to place with larger language distance than those with lower proficiency
- H<sub>2.1b</sub> For migrants with higher Putonghua proficiency, proficiency in the vernacular has .red[less influence] over migration destinations than for those with lower Putonghua proficiency.

--

H<sub>2.2</sub> (Bypassing): When migrants are equipped with communicative NCL proficiency, they are more likely to stay in a migration destination .red[despite the concern of language barriers].

---

## Empirical Test

- (Culturally) Harmonizing effect
    - Interaction model: Whether higher Putonghua proficiency reducing the influence of vernacular (H<sub>2.1b</sub>)

--
    
- (Communicatively) Bypassing effect
    - Quadratic model (H<sub>2.1a</sub>, H<sub>2.2</sub>)

## Result: Haromonizing

No haromonizing effect

background-image: url("images/visualization-capability-1.png")
background-position: center
background-size: contain

class: bottom, right

## Result: Bypassing

???

Vernacular does not disappear, 
quadratic term

---

## Taking-Home Points

*Findings*:

- The diversity of vernaculars in potential destinations still create .red[a barrier] for contemporary Chinese migrants.

- There is no a national communal language reduces the language barrier to cultural assimilation.
    - Merely a way to bypass vernacular language differences

--

*Implications*

- The public function of language policy beyond education
- Resilience of vernaculars: identity construction in modernization and urbanization

???

Language policy with a single NCL has been applied for 60 years.
