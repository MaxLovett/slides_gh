## Overview

**What** and **why** you are doing wrong things in professional writings

--

Everything can get better/correct with a tiny yet crucial **mindset** changing

--

How to **practice** as a good expert writer

## Two Approaches to Teach/Learn Writing

.pull-left[
*Bottom-up*

+ Rule-governing training
+ Low-value materials (memo, reports, slides)
+ High-school style: "Not start writing until thinking through"

]

.pull-right[
*Top-down*

+ For "expert writers"    
.small[Having expert knowledge in a certain area]
+ Writing to .red[help] thinking

&lt;img src = "images/ew_sherlock.gif" &gt;

]

???

Unlike journalists, you write to help thinking, rather than the other way around.

## Major Problem of Expert Writers

.pull-right[
Using language in one pattern to help .navy[thinking] but to .red[read] through another path.

]

--

*Problem for readers*?
{{content}}

???

You create the text through the horizontal process, but it is the vertical process decides whether it works.


1. Slowing down
1. reread over and over (only you have/are forced to read)
1. misunderstand
1. Stop

class: center, middle, normal

Why did nobody tell me about their problem,     
even my teachers?

???

That's also why you have no clue how to handle the problem

--

.large[.red[Paid] to read]

.navy[~~understand the world~~] .red[evaluate you]


???

Never reach the understanding-the-world level: some instructors may say "no, students' work are amazing." Lier! You can asked them back: "do you publish them? how often do you read a student's paper when you don't have to"

Valuable to the readers

When a PhD students come to my office, saying that this is important! I have to write about it!

What journal do you want to submit then? 

Why it matters?

It matters because value is the key! The readers are the key!

This is the problem caused by the examination in school: they do not teach you there are difference among readers

---

class: center, normal

## Idea Is Valuable

--

What you do, when somebody says     
s/he doesn't understand you?

???

You explain it...Don't do that

Because what you explain is to reveal what inside of your head---no one care what's in your head

Only teachers want to know what in your head: because they are paid for it

--

Why do you write?     
To convey your thought, to build up the knowledge.

--

No, it is not.

???

it's to change your readers' ideas. "why should I think that"

--

*True Goals*

+ Helping .red[readers] to understand what they want to understand better.
+ To move the .red[conversation] forward

---

## Who Are the Readers?

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
Nothing would be accepted to be knowledge until it is challenged by who are competent to challenge.
]

.center[
&amp;dArr;

Peer-Review System

&amp;dArr;

Readers who has the professional function to challenge    
a.k.a., editors and reviewers
]

???

(That's why when you point to someone where the library is, rarely they will say...I doubt about that)

---

class: normal, right

## Original Is Valuable

&gt; You need to produce new/original/creative research.
&gt; ---At least one of your professors

--

New knowledge is pretty easy to create

???

how many people in this room? Nobody else in the world knows---but they don't care either.

--

Valuable to your readers?

---

## What's Is Knowledge

.pull-left[
&lt;img src = "images/ew_utopian.png" height = 400&gt;
]

--

.pull-right[
&lt;img src = "images/ew_elite.png" height = 400&gt;
]

???

Ideally, knowledge is cumulative, the old stuff is always there like the left; but no, it is actually only a bunch of people deciding

In the western world, too male, too pale, too stale. (it's changing, way too long, way too small, way to slow, but changing; but except for that this is the real world)

The boundary of the knowledge is permeable (things coming in and out)

## Codes Making Things Important

**Version A**: About democratic regimes and public support, there are two possible relationships. One is that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong.
The other is that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. 
Some research find that countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. 
The others found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or instead that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.

--

**Version B**: It has long been argued that democratic regimes and public support for them are mutually reinforcing: that high levels of public support ensure democracies remain strong, and that experience with democratic governance generates robust public support. But the evidence for either part of this claim has been decidedly mixed. Countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies and just the opposite. Similarly, studies have alternately found that more experience with democracy yields more democratic support or instead that long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue.


???

Going through every article and circling every word in the writing that creating value to the readers. 15 min

Every community has its own codes.

## Writing with Codes

But, either, mixed, alternatively, instead, however, although, inconsistent, anomaly......

.red[Codes of instability]

???

Attention, challenge, contradiction, redflag

Not only grammarly flow/transition words, but showing the tensions

--

Long, argued, evidence, decidedly, studies, Widely, excepted, reported......

.navy[Codes of community]

???

"Making things organized"? No, showing there is a community. I have read your stuff, and I have something to say

Why saying some readers are wrong can get published? With the entering code: wow, you are smart, you are fabulous, you are contributive, but there is a little stuff 

Risky, though: Saying you are great, but I have something new---why should I care about you?
