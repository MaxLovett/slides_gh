第一次泛滥是在1992-1993年间，鼓吹者从意识形态、社会制度乃至文明角度展开了对"中国威胁论"的具体论证。美国费城外交政策研究所亚洲项目主任芒罗首先发难，发表了《正在觉醒的巨龙：亚洲真正的威胁来自中国》，一时间"中国威胁论"风靡太平洋东岸，芒罗因而也声名显赫。哈佛大学教授亨廷顿那篇高论《文明的冲突与世界秩序的重建》也在这个大背景下问世。
前者渲染中美军事冲突不可避免，后者断言儒教文明与伊斯兰教文明的结合将是西方文明的天敌，具有极强的意识形态色彩，美国学者哈克特更是危言耸听，"在苏联解体后，一个新的邪恶帝国正在出现，它的名字叫中国"。此后，每隔一段时期，"中国威胁论"都会出现。

第二波发端于1995-1996年，主要与李登辉访问美国后两岸关系紧张，中美围绕台湾问题发生军事对峙有关。

第三次发生在1998-1999年，其背景是在亚洲经济危机中，中国经济逆势崛起，经济影响力迅速扩大。

进入21世纪后，“中国威胁论”已经是第四波了，其特点是威胁论的内容日益扩大，往往涉及人们的日常生活，如中国计算机黑客威胁论、食品安全威胁论、环境威胁论等等。

1980年4月8日，中共中央决定，成立中央对外宣传小组，作为国际宣传及对港澳台侨宣传的协调策划机构。1982年2月，中央批准了中央对外宣传小组的请示，决定建立新闻发言人制度，在中央不少部门和省一级设立了新闻发言人。1987年机构改革和精简时，考虑到宣传部门的机构设置过多，决定取消中央对外宣传小组，工作归并到中共中央宣传部。1987年12月，中共中央撤销中央对外宣传小组。

1990年3月19日，中共中央决定，恢复中央对外宣传小组。
1991年1月起，中央决定中央对外宣传小组在国务院挂名为“国务院新闻办公室”。

s. While these records are often from local publications, the records may also be statements about China in a given location published by a non-local source. Unfortunately, there is no systematic way of matching the locality of the publisher with that of the 315 923 media reports. However, stories about China in non-local media are often informed through local reporting by a foreign correspondent at the location that interacts with the local context and population. For example, a New York Times article about Chinese gold miners in Ghana is written by foreign correspondents based in West Africa that are probably drawing on local, contextual, knowledge when describing the ‘bitter twist’ in the China-Ghana relationship.
