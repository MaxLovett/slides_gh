## Brief

Second-hand data, first-hand design

+ Data in the "Age of Big Data"
+ Sources of big data
+ Ways to use big data

--

National image building (NIB) resilience
+ Example: Confucius Institutes (CIs) and CI closures in the U.S. 
    + How to examine the closure effect?
    + Do the closures affect the NIB effort,     
to what *extent* and on which *aspect*?

## Big data, big data

> Data sets characterized by huge amounts<sup>1</sup> of frequently updated<sup>2</sup> data in various formats<sup>3</sup>, such as numeric, textual, or images/videos.<sup>4</sup>

[2] Velocity

[4] Two more "v"s: 

Veracity    
Value

???

veracity: accuracy, integrity (how do you know?)  
value: how much value for each unit of data?

## Big Data for Political Science

Volume : Probably more than "commonly-used software" can handle;  

--

Velocity : More relate to commercial, but also the information background setting of policy implementation;  

--

Variety : Statistical techniques + social-science ideas

--

Veracity & Value: What to learn, what to show

???

Huntington: "Political science is not only an interlectural discipline but also a moral one." (1988, APSR)

## What We've Already Known

*Source*

1. Branding effect (Boulding 1959; Buhmann 2016)
1. Identity construction (Ohad and Bar-Tal 2009)

--

*Means*

1. Macro and micro levels (Barr 2012; Xie and Page 2013)
1. Cultural institutions (Brett and Schaefer 2019; Ichijo 2012; Kluver 2014; Lanshina 2015; Vyas 2008, 2008; Weir and O’Sullivan 2017)

???

macro-level (e.g., domestic and economic and social development) and micro-level factors (e.g., elite-level communications and ethnic identities) 

--

*Effect*

1. Effective (Brazys and Dukalskis 2019a; Meng 2020; Owen IV 2010).
1. Noneffective (Lien, Oh, and Selmier 2012; Xie and Page 2013)

## Missing Fact in the Litrature: NIB resilience

Well observed, though (N. Abu-Nasr 2019; Ainslie, Lipura, and Lim 2017; Cowen 2007; PTI 2016, ; Riley and Horowitz 2021; Russia Today 2021; Sishuwa 2019)

+ Area: Middle East, Asia, and Africa
+ Power: U.K., Germany, and Russia
+ Within area: Anti-Hallyu movements in Asia

## Resistance vs. Resilience

.center[
Who drove the closures？

<img src="images/privateVsPublic.jfif" height = 450>]

???

> $H_{1.0}$ (School-driven): CI closures were mainly driven by universities' preferences; public schools were less likely to close CIs.

> $H_{1.1}$ (Politics-driven): CI closures were mainly driven by political preferences; public schools were more likely to close CIs because of the political ideology of the state.

## Examining NIB Resistance

### Data

.pull-left[
+ Subset I
    + CI status
    + University features
    + Government features 
]

.pull-right[
+ Subset II
    + From GDELT 
    + 2004--2020, China related
    + Attention and tones
    + Media-oriented CI distribution
        + 25, 50, 75, 100, 1000km
]

---

### Method

+ Drivers: Conditional effect

\begin{align}
CI\ Status =& \beta_0 + \boldsymbol{School\ Factors}\beta_1 + \boldsymbol{Political\ Factors}\beta_2 + \\
& \beta_3Trade\ War\times Public\ School + \epsilon.
\end{align}

.center[
School factors: Characters of universities   
Political factors: Federal and state
]

+ Consequences: Multi-shock DID with sparse data

$$Media\ Response = \beta_0 + \beta_1Opening\times Closure + \boldsymbol{Controls}\beta + \epsilon.$$
.center[Media response: Media attention + average media tone]

## What Can We Learn

1. Public diplomacy: Resistance yet resilience
1. Soft power: Empirical evidence and mechanism 
1. Culturalist approach: Manageable yet vulnerable

???

1. Two powers, show what works and what remains
1. Empirical evidence of soft power at the mass level
1. Culture is manageable yet it is also vulnerable.
