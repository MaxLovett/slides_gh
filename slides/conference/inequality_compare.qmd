China's gini has been above 0.4 since 2000, and largely remain stable after layoffs in state-owned enterprises, natural diseases, global finaicial crisis, and COVID-19.

The social volcano [@He2003] has not erupted yet. Why?

:::{.notes}
H1: Social comparisons influence perceptions of inequality and preferences for redistribution. Specifically, individuals who engage in upward (downward) social comparisons, comparing themselves to those who are better (worse) off, are more likely to perceive greater (less) income inequality and express stronger (weaker) support for redistribution policies.*

H2: Income levels significantly affect how individuals are influenced by social comparisons. People with higher incomes tend to experience more positive effects from upward comparisons, receiving optimistic signals that lead them to believe less redistribution is necessary. In contrast, those with lower incomes are more likely to experience negative effects from upward comparisons, feeling a sense of deprivation that increases their demand for greater redistribution.

H3: Public sector employment influences individuals' welfare and job stability, thereby affecting the intensity of social comparison. Public sector employees, due to their greater job security and benefits, may perceive less risk from social comparisons and, as a result, may be less supportive of redistribution policies compared to non-public sector employees.

According to the Meltzer-Richard Model, is primarily determined by voters' income levels relative to the median. Individuals with incomes below the median are generally in favor of such policies, as they stand to gain from higher taxes on the wealthy and increased redistribution. They support these measures to improve their own economic conditions. In contrast, those with incomes above the median tend to oppose redistribution policies, as they are concerned that higher taxes and reduced redistribution could diminish their wealth. Therefore, the model suggests that the demand for redistribution is driven by self-interest, with those disadvantaged by income inequality more likely to support policies that aim to address it[@MeltzerRichard1981].

While wealthier individuals generally show less support for redistribution as their income increases, they are more likely to support such policies in countries with high levels of inequality compared to more equal societies[@DimickEtAl2017].In more privileged classes, where individuals encounter fewer market-based risks, there is a stronger alignment between values and attitudes towards redistribution. In contrast, among lower classes, immediate material concerns may overshadow value-based considerations unless mitigated by strong redistribution policies[@KulinSvallfors2013].

Research has shown that individuals exposed to greater labor market risks are generally more supportive of social insurance programs[@HanKwon2020]. Occupational risk, including unemployment[@Margalit2013], and uncertainty about future income [@RehmEtAl2012]also tend to increase support for downward redistribution. For those with lower socioeconomic status, local exposure to inequality tends to increase support for wealth redistribution[@Sands2017]. Moreover, both upward and downward social comparisons can be anxiety-inducing, further exacerbating their sense of insecurity[@CondonWichowsky2020].

## Take-home points

- Social comparisons do not alter Chinese citizen's inequality perception saliently, but do [shape]{.red} their redistribution preferences---[conditioned]{.red} on their classes
- Co-optation provides a different [reference point]{.red} for perceiving inequality and making redistribution preferences

:::{.notes}
- Theoretically, how macro structure enters the micro level
- Empirically, inequality is a problem not only for China. As shown in the SWIID plot. The research helps to learn the conditions for the microfoundation of redistribution demands

:::{.notes}
Income inequality leads to increased social discontent, suppresses people's willingness to cooperate[@NishiEtAl2015], widens the Political participation gap between the poor and the rich[@SzewczykCrowder-Meyer2022], and intensifies social conflicts [@Gurr2015]. The "social volcano" theory is based on such social facts, suggesting that income inequality in China can lead to social unrest and threaten political stability[@GimpelsonTreisman2018; @Cramer2003; @ZhouJin2018]. The issue of inequality has become a pressing social problem that needs to be addressed urgently.
