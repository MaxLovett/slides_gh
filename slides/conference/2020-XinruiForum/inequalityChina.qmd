## TL;DR

*Objective*

- [Macro]{.red} economic characteristics (inequality) &rarr; [micro]{.red} decisions and preferences
    - Jumping over the direct perception

*Method*

- Path analysis

*Findings*

- Objective inequality shapes political trust mainly [via mediators]{.red} rather than directly.
    - Four paths

# Consequences of Inequality

## When Inequality Increases

Economic inequality becomes [prevalent]{.red} globally [@AlvaredoEtAl2017].

## Why Should We Care: Inequality, Perception, and Common Prosperity

**Theoretically** 

+ System &rarr; individual

--

**Empirically**

+ Experience of inequality governance from the Chinese case

--

**Practical**

+ Potential Paths towards Common Prosperity
    + Social welfare
    + Perceptive satisfaction

## Three Influencing Paths

.center[
Path 1: *Governance inequality*   
Economic Inequality &rarr; Class Discrimination  &rarr; Lower Trust

Path 2: *Government Non-responsiveness*   
Economic Inequality &rarr; Low responsiveness on average &rarr; Lower Trust

Path 3: *Judicial Injustice**    
Economic Inequality &rarr; Imbalance sources and odds in judicial affairs &rarr; Lower Trust

Path 4: *Anti-Corruption Inadequacy*    
Economic Inequality &rarr; Dissatisfaction of anti-corruption &rarr; Lower Trust
]



# Empirical Design and Findings

## Research Design

.pull-left[

Data:

*Chinese Household Finance Survey* (CHFS) 2013

+ 28,141 households from 29 provinces 
+ Representative income data for Gini coefficient

*China Urban Governance Survey* (CUGS) 2015

+ 3,513 from 50 prefectures 
+ Later than CHFS
+ Political perceptions

.pull-right[

Method:

*Causal mediation analysis*

+ Multi-mediator estimation
+ central and local governments

## Conclusion

1. Over 90% of the effects from inequality to trust: No need to know inequality
1. Mechanisms
    + Governance inequality < ... < Anti-Corruption
1. Central vs. Local
    + Judicial justice
    + Responsiveness
