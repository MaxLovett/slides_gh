Why are there mixed results? 
Difficutlies in measuring. 
First, pub sp is latent variable, unobservable. Uncertainty. 
Sec, a big challenge is the sparced and fragmented data at aggregate level.

It's is the combination of democratic support and dissatisfaction with current regime performance that generates demand for greater democracy

## Take-Home Points

1. Rethinking Democracy &harr; Public support: .red[~~Sanguine~~] assessment
1. Cross-section time-series diverse-question method: .blue[DCPO]

Uncertainty caused by measurement and in concept. 
without taking uncertainty into account, no way of knowing whether their conclusions are correct or not even their studies have been published in top journals. 

Sanguine, super optimistic fate of democracies rely on their public, but is not well grounded. 
practioners and researchers interested in democracy and understanding democracies should work hard to figour out what is going one. 
we point several potential explanations, but we dont' know which one is right. each of them is worth additional research.
