## Research Question

What Shapes Migrants' decisions?

How does the government do that? 

* Hukou policy: 
    + Does it work? 
    + How does it work?

---

## Hukou Policy

Residence Registration System

--

1/ Residents vis-a-vis Non-residents

--

2/ Alive and well

Favoring the residents

???
government housing, urban education, or even some types of employment

--

3/ Decentralized reform

---

## Theory: Barrier vs. Benefit

Assumption: Moving for better life.

$H_{barrier}:$ People prefer cities with .magenta[less strict] requirements for local hukou status.

--

$H_{benefit}:$ People prefer cities where the potential local .magenta[benefits is big].

* People prefer places where the local hukou is .magenta[more strict].
* People prefer places where they can access hukou benefits, .magenta[regardless of hukou].

---

## Data

Living Environment Satisfaction Survey of Chinese Residents (LESS 2018)

* 1100 respondents

---

* Half migrants, half non-migrants

.center[<img src="images/sampleVisual.png" height = 380 />]

---

## Validation

China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS 2016)

---

## Measurements

* Preference:
    + Willing to move in
    + Willing to stay

---

* Hukou strictness

Subjective: "How difficult to gain the hukou in your current living place?"

--

Objective: A semi-machine learing process

---

* Training set: Hukou openness of 64 cities

(刘金伟. 2016. “我国城市户籍开放程度及其影响因素分析——基于全国63个样本城市的评估.” 《国家行政学院学报》 (05): 91-95+143-144.)

* Input Data: A list of socioeconomic, industrial, and demographic variables of the prefectures.

* Prediction: Chaining random forest
    + 0-1
    + Beijing: 0.927


???

334 prefectures (直辖市及地级行政区)

## Examination Map

### For the barrier theory

Do people know the barrier?

&rarr; Do they care?
    
--

### For the benefit theory

Do people care about a high-valued Hukou?

&rarr; Hukou vs. benefit?

---

## Do People Know and Care?

.center[<img src="images/hukou-aware-1.png" height = 500 />]

---

.center[<img src="images/hukou-care-1.png" height = 450 width = 750/>]

---

## Hukou vs. Benefit?

.center[<img src="images/hukou-stay-1.png" height = 500/>]

---

.center[<img src="images/hukou-experiment-1.png" height = 380/>]

---

.center[<img src="images/hukou-value-1.png" height = 600/>]

---

## Take-home Points

1. People don't care Hukou as much as commonly thought.
1. Hukou does shape (potential) migrants' decisions by loading values.
