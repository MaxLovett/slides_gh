## TL;DR

- Objective
  - Given the multi-identity nature of social members, **when and why** an identity become salient in *important social decision-makings*?
- Theory: Identity [activation]{.red} and [amplification]{.red} theory
    - Trigger effect + Amplifier effect
- Examination: "Citizens vs. mandarins" in China
  - [57,688]{.red} cases + [7,275]{.red} lay People's Assessor (PA) info
- Finding
  - PAs with *leadership positions* tend to rule for the government when the identity is **triggered**.
  - Part-time *representatives* matter and rule for the people when they are **outnumbered** in a judicial panel.

# Identity on important decision-makings

## Research Puzzle 

*Literature shows*

- Identities matter [@Bernstein2005;@PetersArnesen2017;@Li2020], while people have many identities
- Research of identity politics.
    - **More** on embedded identities, e.g., race, gender, and national identity [@MansbridgeTate1992;@GadeWilkins2012]
    - **Less** on detached identities, e.g., work experience, social status, or even class [@Tilly2002]

## On Important Decision-Makings

- Judges
  - Prevalent studies on race (a.k.a., American cases)
    - [Matters]{.blue} [@SteffensmeierBritt2001] vs. [not]{.red} matters [@AnwarEtAl2012]
  - Prevalent studies on gender
    - [Matters]{.blue} in gender-related effects [@BoydEtAl2010a] vs. [only]{.red} gender-related [@HaireMoyer2015]
  - Prevalent studies on party identity: 
    - [Democratics]{.blue} vs. [Republican]{.red} [@Ulmer1962;@EpsteinEtAl2007]
  

:::{.notes}
- Race
  - Steffensmeier and Britt found that black judges were slightly more likely to sentence defendants to prison, regardless of the defendants' race [@SteffensmeierBritt2001]. Cohen and Yang found that black judges issue shorten sentences than others in federal district courts.
 - In cases where race or ethnicity is salient, such as those of affirmative action, racial discrimination, and racial harassment, researchers found that black judges tended to vote in favor of nonwhite plaintiffs [@CohenYang2019].
 - Anwar, however, found no apparent sentencing disparities in felony cases based on judges' race [@AnwarEtAl2012].
 
- Gender
  - Early studies found that female judges ruled more liberally than males in gender-related cases, such as sex discrimination ones [@GryskiEtAl1986; @AllenWall1993]. 
  - Boyd and Epstein examined the decisions of federal appellate court judges in 13 areas and found consistent gender effects only in cases of sex discrimination [@BoydEtAl2010a]. There even exists a "daughter effect." Glynn et al. collected household data on 224 judges in the US courts of Appeals and nearly 10,000 gender-related cases decided by those judges. They found that judges with daughters become more Democratic in these cases. Having a daughter increased judges' knowledge on issues regarding sexual harassment claims. 
  - Other scholars nonetheless reported mixed findings [@GlynnSen2015]. Ashenfelter et al. and Haire et al. reported no or only a slight relationship between gender and judicial decisions [@AshenfelterEtAl1995; @HaireMoyer2015].
Gill et al. found that when hearing immigration appeals, all-male appellate panels were much harsher with male litigants than female litigants [@GillEtAl2017].

- Party identity
  - Ulmer found that Michigan Supreme Court Justices elected under a Democratic Party label were more likely to have pro-worker leanings [@Ulmer1962]. The ensuing attitudinal model postulates a strong relationship between ideology and judicial decision-making [@SegalSpaeth1993; @SegalSpaeth2002; @MartinQuinn2002]. Similarly, recent research on state courts primarily uses party labels as a proxy of state judges' ideological leaning and lends strong evidence to the attitudinal model [@GilesEtAl2001; @EpsteinEtAl2007].

- Jurors: Race and gender[@DeCampDeCamp2020; @HoekstraStreet2021] matters
  - [Symbols]{.blue} [@Ivkovic2007] or [decision makers]{.red} [@Machura2001]? 


## An alternative view of identity

:::{style="text-align:center; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em"}
*Problem*

Ignorance of the **"intersectionality" of identities**
:::

- Identities do not always matters
  - *Until* being (preconsciously) [activated]{.red}

- Embedded identity > detached identity [@Tilly2002]
  - [More vs. less]{.red} appeared in sociopolitical interactions 
  - &rArr; [easy  vs. hard]{.red} to be triggered

# Context: Administrative Litigation (AL)

## Activating Environment of Leading Cadres and Representatives

- AL: "Frail weapon" [@Finder1989;@OBrienLi2004]
- Leading cadres (leaders) & representatives
    - Cadres (**entrenched**): Chief and deputies above township level
    - Representatives (**detached**): People's Congresses (PCs) and the People's Political Consultative Conferences (PPCCs) 
    - [Who do they stay with, citizens or mandarins?]{.red}

## Hypotheses

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
![](images/trigger.jpg){fig-align="center" height=200}

$H_1a$: assessors' [official identity, rather than other identities]{.red}, are more likely to associate with a court decision in favor of the government.   
$H_1b$: assessors' entrenched official identity (leading cadres) are [more salient]{.red} than the [detached]{.red} identity(people's representatives).
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
![](images/amplifier.jpg){fig-align="center" height=200}

$H_2a$: The official assessors' influence on the court decisions is larger when they are [outnumbered]{.red}.    
$H_2b$: Assessors' detached identity (people's representatives) have [equal]{.red} influence as the entrenched official identity (leading cadres) when they are amplified (by being outnumbered).

No: $H_2a$: The official assessors' influence on the court decisions is larger when they are [outnumbered]{.red}.    
Yes $H_2b$: Assessors' detached identity (people's representatives) have [equal]{.red} influence as the entrenched official identity (leading cadres) when they are amplified (by being outnumbered).
