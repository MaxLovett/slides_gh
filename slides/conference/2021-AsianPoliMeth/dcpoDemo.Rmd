## Democracy &larr;?&rarr; Public support


.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3.center[
Democracy &rarr; public support
]

???

Democratic governance &rarr; robust public support

### Empirics

Support .navy[&uarr;] &rarr; democracy .navy[&uarr;] .small[(e.g., Inglehart & Welzel 2005)]    
Support .navy[&uarr;] &rarr; democracy .red[&uarr;] .small[(e.g., Fails and Pierce 2010)]

???

Countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies

Fails, Matthew D. and Heather Nicole Pierce. 2010. “Changing Mass Attitudes and Democratic Deepening.” *Political Research Quarterly* 63(1):174–187.

Democracy .navy[&uarr;] &rarr; support .navy[&uarr;] .small[(e.g., Wuttke et. al. 2020) ]   
Democracy .navy[&uarr;] &rarr; support .red[&uarr;] .small[(e.g., Foa and Mounk 2017)]  

???
More experience with democracy yields more democratic support 

vs.

Long-established democracies are suffering from democratic fatigue

## Latent Variable Analysis Saving the World?

$$Pr(y_{ktqr} = 1) = logist^{-1}[\frac{\bar{\theta}'_{kt} - {(\beta_{qr} + \color{red}{\delta_{kq}})}}{\sqrt{\alpha^2_q + (1.7\times \sigma_{kt})^2}}]$$

$\bar{\theta}$: Group opinion   
&beta;: Question difficulty   
&alpha;: Question dispersion
]

.pull-right[.red[&delta;: Country-specific item bias]]

???

Dispersion: magnitude of the measurement error

## Recent Findings 

Claassen (2020a; 2020b)

+ Support .navy[&uarr;] &rarr; democracy (endurance) .navy[&uarr;] 
+ Democracy .red[&darr;] &rarr; support .navy[&uarr;] &rarr;democracy .navy[&uarr;] &rarr;support .red[&darr;]&rarr;Democracy .red[&darr;]


???

Democratic change has a thermostatic effect on public support, that is that, rather than generating their own support, deepening democracy provokes a backlash and it is instead democratic backsliding that calls forth greater public support


---

## Uncertainty Matters


Claassen (2020a; 2020b) .red[IGNORE] uncertainty.

&hArr; The latent variable is measured .orange["perfectly"].

&rArr; Biased coefficients and standard errors.

---

## Better Method, Better Data

### Incorporation Uncertainty

1. Latent variable estimation &times; .red[1000];
1. Regressing with the .navy[distribution];
1. .navy[Combination] with Rubin's Rule.

--

### Enriched data

1988~2020 (144 countries, 33 years)

Comparing with Claassen (2020a, 2020b):

> 26.2% .red[more] questions;     
33.3% .red[more] survey sources

### Methodology

1. .navy[Multidimensional] support;
1. Conceptual .navy[Difference];
1. Relations with .navy[other values].

]

???

A third is that these survey questions do not ask respondents how they prioritize democracy relative to other values with which it may come into conflict, such as their partisanship, and so miss capturing the true extent of support democracy would find among the public when public support was actually needed.

.pull-right[
### Theory

1. Effectiveness .red[>] existence
1. Support + .red[dissatisfaction]
1. .red[Elite] driven

]

???

It's is the combination of democratic support and dissatisfaction with current regime performance that generates demand for greater democracy

## Take-Home Points


1. Uncertainty matters (a lot)
    + Latent variable analysis
    + Public support of democracy
    
1. Rethinking Democracy &harr; Public support
    + ~~Sanguine~~ assessment
    + Plenty room for future research
