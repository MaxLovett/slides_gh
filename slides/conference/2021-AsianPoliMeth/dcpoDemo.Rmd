### Empirics

Support .navy[&uarr;] &rarr; democracy .navy[&uarr;] .small[(e.g., Inglehart & Welzel 2005)]    
Support .navy[&uarr;] &rarr; democracy .orange[&#8675;] .small[(e.g., Fails & Pierce 2010)]

???

Countries with greater democratic support have been found to become stronger and more stable democracies

## Puzzle Makers: Invisible Opinions

.red[Different] questions

.center[<img src="images/sparsingData.png" height = 450 />]

???
Why are there mixed results? 
Difficutlies in measuring. 
First, pub sp is latent variable, unobservable. Uncertainty. 
Sec, a big challenge is the sparced and fragmented data at aggregate level. 
churchihill items,  democracy has its probles, still the best one. 
milltary rule items, military should govern the country. what do you think. 
Worldwide survey project, 4 years. 
across countries, overtime.

## Latent Variable Analysis Saving the World?

Solt (2020b)

$$Pr(y_{ktqr} = 1) = logist^{-1}[\frac{\bar{\theta}'_{kt} - {(\beta_{qr} + \color{orange}{\delta_{kq}})}}{\sqrt{\alpha^2_q + (1.7\times \color{red}{\sigma_{kt}})^2}}]$$

$$y_{ktqr}\sim  BetaBinomial (y_{ktqr}, \alpha_{ktqr}, \beta_{ktqr})$$

.pull-left[
$\bar{\theta}$: Mean public opinion    
&beta;: Question difficulty   
&alpha;: Question dispersion

The sophisticated measurement models ignite the hope on the studies of relationship between democratic development and public support.

## Uncertainty Matters

&hArr; The latent variable is measured .orange["perfectly"].

&rArr; Biased coefficients and standard errors.

## Better Method, Better Data

### Incorporation Uncertainty

1. Latent variable estimation &times; .red[1000];
1. Regressing with the .navy[distribution];
1. .navy[Combination] with Rubin's Rule.

### Enriched data

It's is the combination of democratic support and dissatisfaction with current regime performance that generates demand for greater democracy

## Take-Home Points


1. Uncertainty matters (a lot)
    + Latent variable analysis
    + Public support of democracy
    
1. Rethinking Democracy &harr; Public support
    + ~~Sanguine~~ assessment
    + Plenty room for future research
???
Uncertanty caused by measurement and in concept. 
without taking uncertainty into account, no way of knowing whether their conclusions are correct or not even their studies have been published in top journals. 

Sanguine, super optimistic fate of democracies rely on their public, but is not well grounded. 
practioners and researchers interested in democracy and understanding democracies should work hard to figour out what is going one. 
we point several potential explanations, but we dont' know which one is right. each of them is worth additional research.
