## Overview

+ Objective: Experience and online political efficacy (OPE)
+ Theory: Response-to-response model
+ Method: Double-shot experiment on Chinese youth
+ Findings and conclusions

---

class: inverse, bottom

## Objective
# GPE and OPE

---

## Political Efficacy

.pull-left[
General political efficacyï¼ˆGPE)
+ Internal: Perception and confidence 
+ External: Government's response
+ Importance: 
    + Predictor: Individual preferences/behaviors
    + Explanation: state-society relationships
]

--

.pull-right[
Online political efficacy (OPE)

+ Mobilizing the most common type of political participation
+ Internal & External
+ Different from GPE
]

--

+ Puzzle of influencers
    + ~~Internet reliance~~ or ~~social media usage~~
    + Information seeking (&check;) and credibility evaluation (&check;)
    + *Experience-future* (?) and *OPE-GPE* (?)


---

class: inverse, bottom

## Theory
# Response-to-Response Model

---

## Response to Response: A View of Government-Mass Relationship

Citizens' demands &rarr; Government .blue[response] &rarr; Citizens' .red[response] to .blue[response]

--

### Experience-Future

H<sub>1</sub>: Impression effect .small[(feedback)] &rArr; external OPE &uarr; &rArr; Expectation  &uarr;

H<sub>2</sub>: Confidence effect .small[(self-efficacy)] &rArr; internal OPE &uarr;  &rArr; Expectation  &uarr;

--

### OPE-GPE

H<sub>3.0</sub>: OPE &uarr; &rArr; GPE &uarr;

H<sub>3.1</sub>: OPE &uarr; &rArr; GPE &darr;

???

Hint: No need for direct engagement.

---

class: inverse, bottom

## Method
# Immedicate and Transmitted Effects

---

class: middle, center

## Researching PE

Survey and interviews &rarr; Endogeneity + confounding effects

--

&dArr;

Experiment (but mostly on internal PEs)

--

&dArr;

Double-shot, double-blind design

???

More information and ability evaluation (solving questions)

---

.pull-left[
Scenarios: 
+ Real-life examples
+ Complaint & demand

Randomization
+ Scenario 
+ Government responses

Measurements:
+ OPE & GPE: PE<sub>post-test</sub> - PE<sub>pre-test</sub>
+ Expectation: E<sub>post-test</sub> - E<sub>pre-test</sub>

Operation: 
+ Survey of Online Behavior Survey of Chinese Youth (OBSCY) 2020

# Findings

---

background-image: url("images/efficacy-plot-1.png")
background-position: center
background-size: contain

???

1. Both impression and confidence improve the internal 
1. Impression affects the external but confidence doesn't

---

background-image: url("images/gpe-plot-1.png")
background-position: center
background-size: contain

???

Impression affects internal and external GPE, but confidence doesn't

Both improve the next-round expectation

---

## Conclusion

External efficacy is important: Sensitive to be affected

--

External efficacy is important: Influential for the future

--

Response is important: Educational psychology &rarr; outcome-reevaluation

--

Response is important: More, better response &rarr; higher expectation.
