# Puzzle and Theory

## Who cares about Taiwan

:::{style="text-align:center"}
*Why should we care?*
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
*Substantive Importance*

- Leverage of the government [@PanEtAl2017;@LiuLi2023]
- Impact across the strait [@WengerChen2017]
- Signal to the U.S. [@Weiss2013]

:::{.notes}
- @PanEtAl2017: Chinese government can take advantage of nationalist protests and influence foreign countries' belief in China’s resolve in crisis management. The higher nationalism, the more likely Chinese leaders decide to use force.
- @WengerChen2017: Weak support in the PRC for looser forms of cross-Strait integration.
- @Weiss2013: The United States has shown a concern and willingness to accommodate Chinese nationalism when dealing with issues related to Taiwan.

:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
*Research Importance*

- Political mobilization [@ChengEtAl2022]
- Group identity &rarr; political cohesion [@HuddyEtAl2013, chap. 23]
- Active audience in political communication [@KreissEtAl2017;@HuShao2022]

:::{.notes}
- @ChengEtAl2022: identifying and targeting different audiences and adopting differentiated information strategies can effectively mobilize public participation
- @KreissEtAl2017: Clarifying the geographical location, demographics, likes and dislikes, and tendencies of the audience can better improve communication efficiency and promote political participation among the public.

## Then, Who

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- Known: Hard-core supporters
  - 6% [@PanEtAl2017] vs. 55% [@LiuLi2023]
  - Ideology-oriented [@PanEtAl2017]:
      - Nationalism + peer pressure [@LiuLi2023]
      - Privileged, strong national pride [@QiEtAl2023]
  - Decompressor
      - Economic, human, and reputational costs [@LiuLi2023]
      - Coastal city residents, [@QiEtAl2023]
:::

:::{.fragment .nonincremental}
- Unknown: [**Active**]{.red} watcher & mentality
  - Survey-based research
    - Cyberspace [@ChenEtAl2023, topic focused, though]
  - Missing psychological traits
:::


:::{.notes}
- @PanEtAl2017: a telephone survey that covers 2,000 respondents from ten major cities in China
- @LiuLi2023: Qualtrics’ online opt-in panel using a quota sampling strategy that targeted pre-specified proportions of gender, age group, and geographic location as benchmarked on the latest census
- @QiEtAl2023: nine-city cell phone survey in 2019

- @LiuLi2023: armed unification, or ‘wutong’, garners only a slim majority (55%) of support, no more than for a range of less aggressive policy options, from using small-scale warfare, to coercing Taipei into negotiating, to simply maintaining the status quo. Only one out of one hundred rejected all but the most extreme option of ‘wutong’. Analyses of respondent attributes further reveal that aggressive policy preferences are primarily driven by nationalism and peer pressure, but dampened by concerns about the economic, human, and reputational costs of non-peaceful unification and the likelihood of US intervention.
- @QiEtAl2023: Wu-tong supporters: the politically, economically, and socially privileged groups and those with stronger national pride and more understanding of Taiwan were more pro-armed unification, while residents of the two coastal cities, Xiamen and Guangzhou, were less supportive.

# Exploring Active Taiwan Watchers via Social Media

## Data Collection & Research Design

- Timing: 2016 election (01-14 ~ 01-19)
- Data
    - Taiwan topic followers via governmental Weibo account
    - Comments and retweets (N = 3,3962) from 191 posts
- Design
    - Personality analysis [@DinesenEtAl2014; @GreeneRobertson2017; @Truex2022]

        - Explicit traits: Big 5 (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism)
        - Implicit: Depression, intimacy, and honest

## Measurements

- Psychological traits
    - Explicit: Percentage of feature words from LIWC relates to the traits [@GolbeckEtAl2011]
    - Implicit: Function words analysis
        - Pronoun usage and exclusive words [@NewmanEtAl2003]
- Predicted variables
    - Retweet behaviors: response rounds, response length, sentence complexity, vocabulary richness, attitudinal preference
    - Communication building: discussion rounds, discussion size, rounds w. substantive meaning, vocabulary richness
- Alternative explanatory variables: Gender, age, social status, media type, content features (post length, topics, and sentiments)

- Openness: Audit, cash, owe
- Conscientiousness: Mate, talk, they, 
- Extraversion: Observing, heard, feeling
- Agreeableness: Happy, cried, abandon
- Neuroticism: Worried, fearful, nervous
