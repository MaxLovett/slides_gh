## TL;DR

- Objective
  - Given the multi-identity nature, **when and how** an identity impacts important social decision-makings?
- Theory: Identity intersectionality theory
    - [Trigger]{.red} effect + [Amplifier]{.red} effect
- Examination: [Leaders]{.red} in "Citizens vs. mandarins" in China
  - *57,688* cases + *7,275* lay People's Assessor (PA) info
- Finding
  - PAs with "full-time" *leadership* tend to rule for the government when the identity is triggered.
  - "Part-time" leader PAs (i.e., *representatives*) matter and rule for the people when they are outnumbered in a judicial panel.

## Learned and Puzzled in Identity Research {.Small}

:::: {.columns}

*Known*

- Identity matters in general [@Bernstein2005;@PetersArnesen2017;@Li2020]
- On important decisions (e.g., judicial ~)
  - Judges (vs. accused):
    - Race: [Matters]{.blue} [@SteffensmeierBritt2001] vs. [not]{.red} matters [@AnwarEtAl2012]
    - Gender: [Matters]{.blue} in gender-related effects [@BoydEtAl2010a] vs. [only]{.red} gender-related [@HaireMoyer2015]
    - Party: [Democratics]{.blue} vs. [Republican]{.red} [@Ulmer1962;@EpsteinEtAl2007]
  - Jurors: Race and gender[@DeCampDeCamp2020; @HoekstraStreet2021] matters
  
:::{.notes}
- Race
  - Steffensmeier and Britt found that black judges were slightly more likely to sentence defendants to prison, regardless of the defendants' race [@SteffensmeierBritt2001]. Cohen and Yang found that black judges issue shorten sentences than others in federal district courts.
 - In cases where race or ethnicity is salient, such as those of affirmative action, racial discrimination, and racial harassment, researchers found that black judges tended to vote in favor of nonwhite plaintiffs [@CohenYang2019].
 - Anwar, however, found no apparent sentencing disparities in felony cases based on judges' race [@AnwarEtAl2012].
 
- Gender
  - Early studies found that female judges ruled more liberally than males in gender-related cases, such as sex discrimination ones [@GryskiEtAl1986; @AllenWall1993]. 
  - Boyd and Epstein examined the decisions of federal appellate court judges in 13 areas and found consistent gender effects only in cases of sex discrimination [@BoydEtAl2010a]. There even exists a "daughter effect." Glynn et al. collected household data on 224 judges in the US courts of Appeals and nearly 10,000 gender-related cases decided by those judges. They found that judges with daughters become more Democratic in these cases. Having a daughter increased judges' knowledge on issues regarding sexual harassment claims. 
  - Other scholars nonetheless reported mixed findings [@GlynnSen2015]. Ashenfelter et al. and Haire et al. reported no or only a slight relationship between gender and judicial decisions [@AshenfelterEtAl1995; @HaireMoyer2015].
Gill et al. found that when hearing immigration appeals, all-male appellate panels were much harsher with male litigants than female litigants [@GillEtAl2017].

- Party identity
  - Ulmer found that Michigan Supreme Court Justices elected under a Democratic Party label were more likely to have pro-worker leanings [@Ulmer1962]. The ensuing attitudinal model postulates a strong relationship between ideology and judicial decision-making [@SegalSpaeth1993; @SegalSpaeth2002; @MartinQuinn2002]. Similarly, recent research on state courts primarily uses party labels as a proxy of state judges' ideological leaning and lends strong evidence to the attitudinal model [@GilesEtAl2001; @EpsteinEtAl2007].

*Unknown*

- In general
  - Primarily on embedded identities, then how about **detached** identities and identity **intersectionality** [@Tilly2002]?
- On court
  - Juror: [Symbols]{.red} [@Ivkovic2007] or decision [makers]{.blue} [@Machura2001]? 
- On China
  - How identity affects Chinese sociopolitical lives?

## An identity intersectionality theory

- Problem to solve: Ignorance of **multiple**-identity + **intersectionality**
  - An identity won't matter *until* being [activated]{.red}
  - Identity influence hierarchy: Embedded identity > detached identity
  - [More vs. less]{.red} appeared in sociopolitical interactions     
  &rArr; [easy  vs. hard]{.red} to be triggered
- Empirical context: 
  - Important decisions making: Administrative litigation (AL)
      - Citizens or mandarins, "frail weapon" [@Finder1989]
  - Important decision makers: Full-time and part-time leaders
      - Leading cadres (**embedded**): Chief and deputies above township level
      - Representatives (**detached**): People's Congresses (PCs) and the People's Political Consultative Conferences (PPCCs)

## Results

![+ Placebo test (on other litigation) & interviews (on judges)](http://103.238.162.29:10002/webdav/sammo3182/figure/assessor_coef_leader.png){height=500}

:::{.notes}
$H_1a$: assessors' [official identity, rather than other identities]{.red}, are more likely to associate with a court decision in favor of the government.   
$H_1b$: assessors' embedded official identity (leading cadres) are [more salient]{.red} than the [detached]{.red} identity(people's representatives).

:::{.notes}
No: $H_2a$: The official assessors' influence on the court decisions is larger when they are [outnumbered]{.red}.    
Yes $H_2b$: Assessors' detached identity (people's representatives) have [equal]{.red} influence as the embedded official identity (leading cadres) when they are amplified (by being outnumbered).

## Conclusion

- Identity effect [>]{.red} race + gender
- When and how *beyond who*:
  - Trigger &rarr; embedded identity [&check;]{.red}
  - Amplifier &rarr; detached identity [&check;]{.red}
- Identity politics in non-common law courts
  - Assessor matters
  - Identity matters
  - Sociopolitical powers [**&rarr;**]{.red} judicial decision
