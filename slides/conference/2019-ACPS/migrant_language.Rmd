## Research Question

* What affects (domestic) migrants' decisions?
    + Where to go
    + How long to stay
--

Our answer: Language

--

* What can the government do?

---

## Why Language?

### Known

* Language matters
    + Socioeconomically
    + Culturally
    + Migration outcome

--

### Unknown

* Language effect on decision-making
* Language manipulation by the government

---

## Study 1: Does Language Matter?

### How does language affect migration decisions?

Barriers in communication & culture

--

$H_1$: Migrants prefer the place with a weaker language barrier.

---

## Data

1. China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS) 2016
    + Nationally representative sample
    + Special battery for the migrants
    
--

1. Living Environment Satisfaction Survey of Chinese Residents (LESS) 2018
    + Nationwide online sample
    + Both migrants and non-migrants
    + Survey experiments

---

Measurement of language barrier

1. Language closeness

--

1. Vernacular proficiency

---

### Experiment

.small[Assuming you have a plan to leave from the city your hukou was registered, there are two available options: City A and B. The two cities are very similar... The difference is that you are expected to earn twice as much in City A as in City B, while the average living cost in A is also about 1. 5 times of the cost in B. Given these conditions, where do you prefer to move, A or B?]

--

.red[The vernacular in City B is quite similar to your mother tongue. You can make smooth communication there with no problem, while the vernacular of City A is very different from yours.]

## Results

---

<img src="image/barrier_exp.png" height = 500 width = 750 />

---

## Study II: What Can Governments Do?

Promoting a national communal language (NCL).

--

1. Harmonizing effect: NCL replaces the vernacular.
    + $H_{2.1}$: NCL &uarr; Vernacular &darr;

--


2. Bypass effect: alternative path to vernacular 
    + $H_{2.2}$: NCL & Verancular coexist + U-shape

---

## Harmonizing: Moderation Model

<img src="image/hammer.png" height = 500 width = 750 />

---

## Bypass: Quadratic Model

<img src="image/bypass.png" height = 500 />

---

## Regional Variance

<img src="image/cross-region.png" height = 500 />

---

## Conclusion

* **Migration**: Language matters and language policy works.

--

* **Modernization**: More communication than culture.

Selection and later decisions
