## Research Question

* Language effects in migration decision-making
* Government's "invisible hand"

---

## What We Know and Don't

### Known

* Language matters
    + Socioeconomic life (Tang, Hu & Jin 2018)
    + Social identity (Anderson 2006; Safran 2005)
    + Migration outcome (Gorinas & Pytlikova 2015; Wang et al 2018)

--

### Unknown

* Language effect in decision-making
* Language manipulation

---

## Language Matters: A Theory

Communication function + cultural function

--

### Language effect

* Favor place with lower barrier
* Better vernacular, more likely to stay
    
--
    
### Policy effect

Better national common language (NCL), then...

--

Hammer vs. Bypass

* Hammer: Language barrier's effect shrink
* Bypass: Making decision regardless barriers

---

## Data and Methods

China: 

1. Multilinguistic country
2. Single NCL

--

China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS 2016)

* Language barrier: 
    + Language closeness (Liu et al. 2015)
    + Vernacular proficiency
* Policy effect: Putonghua proficiency

???

## Experiment

### Issues

* Regional preference
* Migrant experience
* Survey to migrants

--

### Design

Living Environment Satisfaction Survey of Chinese Residents (LESS 2018)

Assuming you have a plan to leave from the city your hukou was registered, there are two available options: City A and B. The two cities are very similar. Both are in economically developed areas and have similar distances to your hukou city. You don’t have any social relations to either of them. The difference is that you are expected to earn twice as much in City A as in City B, while the average living cost in A is also about 1. 5 times of the cost in B. .red[The vernacular in City B is quite similar to your mother tongue. You can make smooth communication there with no problem, while the vernacular of City A is very different from yours.] Given these conditions, where do you prefer to move, A or B?

## Governmental Policy: Hammer

## Discussion

* Language matters
* Invisible hand works (bypass)

--

**Migration**: Alternative factors
**Modernization**: More communication than culture.
