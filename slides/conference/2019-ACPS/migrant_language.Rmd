## Research Question

* What affects (domestic) migrants' decisions?
    + Where to go
    + How long to stay
--

Our answer: Language

--

* What can the government do?

---

## Why Language?

### Known

* Language matters
    + Socioeconomically
    + Culturally
    + Migration outcome

--

### Unknown

* Language effect on decision-making
* Language manipulation by the government

---

## Study 1: Does language matter?

### How does language affect migration decisions?

Barriers in communication & culture

--

.small[H1: When migrants determent where to migrate or whether to remain where they are, they prefer the place with a weaker language barrier.]

---

## Examination

Data: 

1. China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS) 2016
    + Nationally representative sample
    + Special battery for the migrants
    
--

1. Living Environment Satisfaction Survey of Chinese Residents (LESS) 2018
    + Nationwide online sample
    + Detail questions + experiments

---

Measurement of language barrier

1. Language closeness: Linguistic measurement, random tree

--

1. Vernacular proficiency: Usage measurement, subjective evaluation

---

### Experiment

.small[Assuming you have a plan to leave from the city your hukou was registered, there are two available options: City A and B. The two cities are very similar... The difference is that you are expected to earn twice as much in City A as in City B, while the average living cost in A is also about 1. 5 times of the cost in B. Given these conditions, where do you prefer to move, A or B?]

--

.red[The vernacular in City B is quite similar to your mother tongue. You can make smooth communication there with no problem, while the vernacular of City A is very different from yours.]

## Results

## Study II: What can governments do?

### Two mechanisms of the language policy

A. Harmonizing effect: reducing the influence of vernacular 

.small[H 2.1a: Migrants with higher Putonghua proficiency are more likely to migrate to place with larger language distance than those with lower proficiency.
]
.small[H 2.1b: For migrants with higher Putonghua proficiency, proficiency in the vernacular has less influence over migration destinations than for those with lower Putonghua proficiency. ]

---

B. Bypass effect: alternative path to vernacular 

.small[H2.2: Migrants with higher NCL proficiency are more likely to stay in a migration destination despite the concern of language barriers.]

--

.small[Coexistance + U-shape]


---

## Harmonizing: Moderation Model

<img src="image/hammer.png" height = 500 width = 750 />

---

## Bypass: Quadratic Model

<img src="image/bypass.png" height = 500 />

---

## Regional Variance and Robustness Check

<img src="image/cross-region.png" height = 500 />

---

## Conclusion

* **Migration**: Language matters and language policy works.

--

* **Modernization**: More communication than culture.

Selection and later decisions
