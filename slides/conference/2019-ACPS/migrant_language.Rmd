## Research Question

* Language effects in migration decision-making
* What can be changed (by the government)?

---

## What We Know and Don't

### Known

* Language matters
    + Socioeconomic life (Tang, Hu & Jin 2018)
    + Social identity (Safran and Liu 2005)
    + Migration outcome (Boyd and Cao 2009)

--

### Unknown

* Language effect on decision-making
* Language manipulation by the government

---

## Language Matters: A Theory

Communication model + culture model

--

### Language effect

* Favoring place with lower barrier
* Better vernacular, more likely to stay
    
--
    
### Policy effect

Better national common language (NCL), then...

---

## Hammer vs. Bypass

* Hammer: Crashing the barrier

---

* Bypass: Alternative to vernacular

<img src="image/bypass.gif" height = 500 />

---

## Data and Methods

China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS 2016)

* Language barrier: 
    + Language closeness (Liu et al. 2015)
    + Vernacular proficiency
* Policy effect: Putonghua proficiency

## Experiment

### Issues

* Regional preference
* Migrant experience
* Survey to migrants

--

### Solution

Living Environment Satisfaction Survey of Chinese Residents (LESS 2018)

---

.small[Assuming you have a plan to leave from the city your hukou was registered, there are two available options: City A and B. The two cities are very similar... The difference is that you are expected to earn twice as much in City A as in City B, while the average living cost in A is also about 1. 5 times of the cost in B. Given these conditions, where do you prefer to move, A or B?]

--

.red[The vernacular in City B is quite similar to your mother tongue. You can make smooth communication there with no problem, while the vernacular of City A is very different from yours.]

## Is There a Barrier

## Governmental Policy: Hammer

---

## Governmental Policy: Bypass

---

## Regional Variance and Robustness Check

---

## Discussion

* Language matters
* Invisible hand works (bypass)

--

* **Migration**: Alternative factors
* **Modernization**: More communication than culture.
