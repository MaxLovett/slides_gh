## Research Question

What leads migrants' decisions?
+ Where to go
+ How long to stay

Apart from economic demands

--

Our answer: Language

+ Socioeconomically
+ Culturally
+ Migration outcome

---

## Theory

### Language matters

+ Migrants prefer to .red[linguistically close] area.

--

### Language matters as a bypass rather than harmonizer.

National communal language (NCL)

+ Bypass: NCL & Vernacular .blue[coexist] + .red[threshold]
+ Harmonizer: NCL replaces vernacular

## Study 1: Matters in Terms of Linguistical Closeness

> .small[Assuming you have a plan to leave from the city your hukou was registered, there are two available options: City A and B. The two cities are very similar... The difference is that you are expected to earn twice as much in City A as in City B, while the average living cost in A is also about 1. 5 times of the cost in B. Given these conditions, where do you prefer to move, A or B?]

--

"The vernacular in City B is .red[quite similar to your mother tongue], while the vernacular of City A is very different from yours."

## Study 2: Mechanism

### Source

1. China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS)
1. Living Environment Satisfaction Survey of Chinese Residents (LESS) 

### Measurement

1. Language closeness
1. Vernacular proficiency

## Conclusion

* **Migration**: Language matters.

--

* **Modernization**: More communication than culture.
