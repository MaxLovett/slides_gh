## Process-based Trust?

* Institutional-based vs. Process-based trust (Zucker 1986)

* Imagined vs. Engaged (Thomas 1998; Wang 2005)

* Support for the government and regime legitimacy (Tolbert and Mossberger 2006; Li 2004; Reisinger et al. 2017)

* Scenario I: Shuffle Response

> Earlier this month, a downstairs neighbor continually made loud noises in the apartment beneath the one in which one of your classmates lives. It had a serious effect on people's lives there. To resolve this issue, the parent of your classmate called the public service hotline. The call was first transferred to the .magenta[City Department of Property Management] and then to the .magenta[Municipal Construction Committee]. Public servants responded to the call in the following recording.

???

Municipal [mjuˈnɪsəpəl]

假设你一个同学家楼下是底商。本月初发现楼底下有极大的噪音，请专人测量确实噪音已经超出了规定范围。调查发现底商中央空调的压缩机产生的。为了解决这个问题，这位同学的家长打电话给12345市民服务热线，先后被转到物管办和住建委。录音记录了他们的回应。

* Questions on each speaker respectively.
    + General trust (Trust game)
    + Emotional closeness (IOS measurement)
    + Content authenticity
        + e.g., "*Given there is one department in the recording actually responsible to the complaint, which department do you think it is, City Department of Property Management or Municipal Construction Committee?*"

???

* 总体信任
* 感情上亲切
* 内容上可信: 如果实际应负责单位就是这两个部门中一个（先听到的是物管办，后听到的是住建委），那么您觉得刚才的通话中是哪个部门在不作为呢？

Results do not substantively change after controlling for female, local growth, family income, interpersonal trust, mandarin proficiency.

* Over 87% countries have at least one official language.

* Domestic $\leadsto$ local & cross-national.
    + Valid experimental approach.

## Measurement of General Trust

Trust game:

* Strength: Abstract trust $\rightarrow$ money decision
* Process: Subjects have ten golden coins
    + Play with the speaker
    + 1-coin investment from subject = 3-coin profits of speaker
    + Speaker decides how much to return
    + Goal: maximize the own coins
