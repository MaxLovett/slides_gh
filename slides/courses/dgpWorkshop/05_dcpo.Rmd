## Source of the Puzzle: Invisible Opinions

.red[Different] questions

.center[<img src="../../conference/2021-AsianPoliMeth/images/sparsingData.png" height = 450 />]

???
Why are there mixed results? 
Difficutlies in measuring. 
First, pub sp is latent variable, unobservable. Uncertainty. 
Sec, a big challenge is the sparced and fragmented data at aggregate level. 
churchihill items,  democracy has its probles, still the best one. 
milltary rule items, military should govern the country. what do you think. 
Worldwide survey project, 4 years. 
across countries, overtime.

## Operation

1. Collect survey data and identify the survey items (.blue[crowd-sourcing]);
1. Generate raw dataset (using `DCPOtools`, .red[automated]);
1. Reformat dataset for model (using `DCPOtools`, .red[automated]);
1. Analyze the data with `DCPO`
1. Diagnosis for convergence with `shinystan`.

## Scale of Surveys

Academic and public surveys

--

Multilingual;

--

Once or cross-sectional time-series (CSTS), long series are prefered, though

# Application

## Example: Finish Survey Data

.center[
Step 1: Go to the [Finish Survey Data](https://services.fsd.tuni.fi/disco/discovery?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fservices.fsd.uta.fi%2F&return=https%3A%2F%2Fservices.fsd.tuni.fi%2FShibboleth.sso%2FLogin%3FSAMLDS%3D1%26target%3Dss%253Amem%253Ade320958e85a7a473cf0373f9620630a84c82a54466edd4183f7fb66323f9ea3&lang=en) website.

- Don't worry if it is not in English. A number have an English version
    - Even they don't, browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.) have translators.

.center[Step 2: Sign-up an account]

- Not always necessary, such as for Pew Data
- Signing up accounts usually requires institutional email addresses
- Try to find "Sign-up"; if not, click "log-in"

Step 3: Log in and check the *Information Release* after receiving the username and pin

class: center

Step 4: Click the "Data" tab

<img src = "images/dcpo_data.png" height = 550>


---

class: center

Step 5: Click the "series" link

<img src = "images/dcpo_series.PNG" height = 550>

---

class: center

Step 6: Finding the series assigned to you, e.g., the EVA.

<img src = "images/dcpo_eva.png" height = 550>

---

class: center

Step 7: Click the "EVA Surveys on Finnish Values and Attitudes" and     
choose the "Studies" tab 

<img src = "images/dcpo_study.png" height = 550>

---

class: center

Step 8: Click the "Download the data" link on the right panel;    
Also click the "Codebook" link

<img src = "images/dcpo_sources.png" height = 550>

---

class: center

Step 8.1: Sometimes you need to click the "Download data" tab and the "Download data" button to get the data

<img src = "images/dcpo_downloadData.png" height = 550>

---

class: center

Fill in the purpose of usage and other info to accomplish the "Access application"

<img src = "images/dcpo_purpose.png" height = 550>

---

class: center

Step 9: Create a folder named "FSD3494," the name of the downloaded file.    
Step 10: Save both the data and codebook there.

<img src = "images/dcpo_codebook.png" height = 500>

---

Step 10: Download the [`survey_additions_template.csv`](https://github.com/fsolt/DCPOtools/blob/master/data-raw/survey_additions_template.csv)

--

You'll see many columns. But for a single-country dataset, you onlly need to fill:

- "survey"
- "courntry_v"
- "year"
- "wt"
- "archive"
- "surv_prog"
- "file_id"
- "cb_link"
- "link."  

--

The full information and meaning of the columns are available [here](https://github.com/fsolt/DCPOtools/wiki/How-to-add-new-surveys).

---

class: small

<img src = "images/dcpo_template.png" height = 100>

--

Some notes:

- Use the codebook find the year when the survey was carried out, and variable name for weighting.

--

- Be care for about the weighting variable, making sure the variable name is the same with the variable name in the dataset
    - Especially for non-English surveys, check the var_name in the data file

--

- If there are multiple surveys in one year, noting it in survey column, such "fsdeva2020fall."

--

- `cb_link` is the link for codebook.

--

- `link` is the link to the series. 

--

- Fill up data link if there is link for the data set
    - Not in our case since the data cannot be downloaded directly.

---

Step 11: Open the data and convert it into a format that R can read

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
rio::convert("FSD3494/daF3388e.csv", "FSD3494/FSD3494.RData")
```

NB: Make sure the file names are consistent.

---

## When the Codebook Isn't English

Use the translation tool to translate the file and then find weight variable.
Be CAREFUL about the variable name and check the variable name in
the data.

Open the data in R and check the variables' names.
