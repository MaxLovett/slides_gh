## What's Big Data?

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
Data sets characterized by huge amounts<sup>1</sup> of frequently updated<sup>2</sup> data in various formats<sup>3</sup>, such as numeric, textual, or images/videos.<sup>4</sup>  
]

--

[1] **.red[V]olume**  
[2] **.red[V]elocity**  
[3] **.red[V]ariety**

[4] Two more "**.red[v]**"s: veracity and value

???

veracity: accuracy, integrity (how do you know?)  
value: how much value for each unit of data?

## Example: Relationship Analysis

Petition -?&rarr; *Dibao*

.center[<img src="images/big_JiangMengZhao2019.png" height = 400 />]

???

Jiang, Junyan, Tianguang Meng, and Qing Zhang. 2019. “From Internet to Social Safety Net: The Policy Consequences of Online Participation in China.” *Governance* 32(3): 531–646.

1. 900,000 petitions
    + A substantial share of the LLMB (Local Leader Message Board) petitions concern personal problems that are most likely to be experienced by lower-class citizen.
    + A sizable share of the petitions are originated from rural and suburban areas


(pocketbook: individual economic sources)


2. 4,400 government reports at both the city and provincial levels between 2000 and 2014
    + cities that receive a larger number of online petitions in a year tend to devote significantly higher proportions of government reports in the following year to a topic on social welfare
    + policy effect appears to be mainly driven by petitions filed by rural residents concerning issues related to their pocketbook conditions.

## Issues about Big-Data Based Analysis

1. How "big" is big?
1. Anything new?
1. Where are they from?
1. How do we understand?
1. Is it morally correct?
