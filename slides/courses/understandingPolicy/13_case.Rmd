## Overview

1. What's a case study (what's a case)?
1. Why doing case study?
1. Fundamental logic of case study
1. How to pick a case

## What's a Case Study

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
An intensive study of a .magenta[single unit] for the purpose of understanding a larger class of (similar) units.

.pull-left[

### What's A Case

A unit within a boundary

+ Spatial
+ Temporal
]

--


### Basic types of cases

1. One unit over time
1. N subunit at one time
1. N subunit over time

Hint: Varying is the key!

---

## Why (Single) Case

You should conduct a case study when you are looking for...

* .red[Deep] rather than broad, bounded scope of proposition
* .red[Comparing] with rather than represent other cases
* .red[Mechanism] rather than effect
* .red[Deterministic] rather than probabilistic relations
* .red[Exploring] rather than confirmatory test

### Why not being representative?

Randomization is cool, right?


Why not randomly bring a case to analyze?


???

Representativeness roots from large-N analysis

## Fundamental Logic of Analytic Case Studies

Most .red[similar] systems    
Most .red[different] systems

---

## Most Similar Systems (Concomitant Variation)

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
The belief that systems as similar as possible with respect to as many features as possible constitute the optimal samples for comparative inquiry.

.tr[

Concomitant: something that happens at the same time as another thing and is connected with it.

**Explanatory Variable**: intersystemic .red[differences]

--

**Control Variables**: .red[Similarities] between the systems

--

**Assumption**: Characteristics shared by one group of systems, such as can be .red[removed].

## E.g.: About Leadership Powerfulness

```{r leadership}
text_tb <- data.frame(US = c("American continent", "Broad territory", "Anglo-Saxon", "Democracy", "Federal", "Presidential"), 
                      Canada = c("American continent", "Broad territory", "Anglo-Saxon", "Democracy", "Federal", "Parliamentary"))
rownames(text_tb) <- c("Position", "Size", "Culture", "Polity", "Government", "Legislature")

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "cll")%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25, bootstrap_options = c("responsive"))
```

What argument can this study make?

## Practice
.pull-left[
Beijing's waste-sorting policy works?

.center[<img src="images/case_wasteSorting.png" height = 200 />]
]
.pull-right[
Cooling-off period works?
.center[<img src="images/case_coolingOff.png" height = 250 width = 500 />]

]

### Requirements

1. Define an outcome variable
1. Pick an explanatory variable
1. Make a most-similar-case study design
1. Descriptive (the conditions of) the cases 
1. Writing out and shoot to our class chat group in .red[10min]

```{r stopwatch_presenter, echo = FALSE}
library(countdown)

countdown(
  minutes = 10,
  seconds = 0,
  warn_when = 30,
  right = "0%",
  bottom = "5%",
  font_size = "3.5em",
  play_sound = TRUE
)

```

## Most Different System


.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
The alternative strategy takes as the starting point the variation of the
observed behavior at a level lower than that of systems...If the relationship between an independent and the dependent variable is the same within the subgroups of the population, then again the systemic differences need not be taken into consideration.

**Explanatory Variable**: intrasystemic .red[similarities]

**Control Variables**: .red[Differences] in the common systemic characteristics

**Assumption**: Systemic factors .red[do not play any role] in explaining the observed behavior.

## E.g.: About the Cause of the Revolution

.center[<img src="images/case_skocpol.png" height = 550 />]

???

Skocpol, Theda. 1979. *States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China*. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.


Causes of revolution:

First, there must be a "crisis of state," often provoked by international factors.

Second, patterns of class dominance determine which group will rise up to exploit the revolutionary situation.

## Summary

```{r mssMds}
text_tb <- data.frame( Item = c("Assumption", "EV", "Control", "OV Type"),
  MSS = c("Similarity is irrelevant", "Difference", "Shared properties", "Sufficiency"), 
  MDS = c("Differences is irrelevant", "Similarity", "Different features", "Necessity"))

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "lll") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
      column_spec(2:3, border_right = T)
```

Hint:

Sufficient conditions: As long as A occurs, there must be B.

Necessary conditions: Without B, A won't occur.
