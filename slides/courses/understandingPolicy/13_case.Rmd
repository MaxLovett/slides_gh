## Overview

1. What's a case study (what's a case)?
1. Why doing case study?
1. Fundamental logic of case study
1. How to pick a case

## A Glimpse of Interpretive Methods

+ Case study

.gray[
+ Process tracing

+ Interviews and others
]

## What's a Case Study

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
An intensive study of a .magenta[single unit] for the purpose of understanding a larger class of (similar) units.

### A Case?

Common understanding:

A unit within a boundary

+ Spatial
+ Temporal

### Observations, Variable, or Cases?

```{r cases}
text_tb <- data.frame(Observed = 1:4,
                      Gender = rep(c("Male", "Female"), times = 2), 
                      Country = rep(c("US", "UK"), each = 2))

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "crr")%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25, bootstrap_options = c("responsive"))
```
]

---

## Common Components of a Case Study

### Target

Covariational relations

--

### Basic types

1. One unit over time
1. N subunit at one time
1. N subunit over time

---

## Why Single Case?

* Deep rather than broad, bounded scope of proposition
* Comparing rather than represent other cases
* Mechanism rather than effect
* Deterministic rather than probabilistic relations
* Exploring rather than confirmatory test

---

## Why don't we let the case be representative?

Randomization is cool, right?

Why not?!


???

Representativeness roots from large-N analysis

---

## Fundamental Logic of Case Comparison

* Most similar systems
* Most different systems

---

## Most Similar Systems (Concomitant Variation)

> The belief that systems as similar as possible with respect to as many features as possible constitute the optimal samples for comparative inquiry.
---Przeworski and Teune (1970, 32)

---

## Leadership Powerfulness


```{r}
text_tb <- data.frame(US = c("American continent", "Broad territory", "Anglo-Saxon", "Democracy", "Federal", "Presidential"), 
                      Canada = c("American continent", "Broad territory", "Anglo-Saxon", "Democracy", "Federal", "Parliamentary"))
rownames(text_tb) <- c("Position", "Size", "Culture", "Polity", "Government", "Legislature")

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "cll")%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25, bootstrap_options = c("responsive"))
```

## Principles of the Most Similar System

**Focus**: .magenta[inter]systemic differences

--

**Assumption**: Characteristics shared by one group of systems, such as can be removed (control)

--

**Explanatory**: Difference

--

**Control**: Similarities between the systems

---

## Practice

1. How do we know if the policy of waste sorting works? 
1. What environmental policies (giving a pair of examples) is best for a given city? 
1. When another contagion comes, what should a local government do?
1. What forms the political correctness of a society? 

---

## Most Different System

Skocpol, Theda. 1979. States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

---

## Principles of Most Different systems

* **Focus**: .magenta[intra]systemic similarities and differences

--

* **Assumption**: systemic factors do not play any role in explaining the observed behavior.

--

* **Explanatory**: Similarity

--

* **Control**: Differences in the common systemic characteristics

---

## Practice

1. How do we know if the policy of waste sorting works? 
1. What environmental policies is best for a given city? 
1. When another contagion comes, what should a local government do?
1. What forms the political correctness of a society? 

Yeah, yeah, the same questions~~

---

## Comparison

```{r}
text_tb <- data.frame( Item = c("Assumption", "Focus", "Control", "Target"),
  MSS = c("Similarity is irrelevant", "Difference", "Shared properties", "Sufficiency"), 
  MDS = c("Differences is irrelevant", "Similarity", "Different features", "Necessity"))

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "lll") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
      column_spec(2:3, border_right = T)
```

---

## How To Pick a Case?

Core principle: Minimizing .magenta[selection bias]

.center[<img src="images/selectionBias.gif" height = 400 />]

---

## Different Selection, Different Consequences

.center[<img src="images/selectionX.png" height = 500 />]

???

Select X

---

.center[<img src="images/selectionY.png" height = 600 />]

???

Select Y

---

.center[<img src="images/selectionXY.png" height = 600 />]

???

Select XY

---

.center[<img src="images/ideal.png" height = 500 />]

---

## When Selection Can Be Useful

### Most similar/different systems

--

### Least-likely case

If the theory can make it here, it can make it anywhere.

--

### Deviant Cases

Cases that do not conform to the predictions made by the theory

---

## Take-Home Points

+ Logic of case comparison
  + Most similar
  + Most different
+ Case selection
  + Selection on X
  + Selection on Y
  + Selection on XY
