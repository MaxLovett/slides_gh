## Madison's Pluralism

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, .magenta[adversed] to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.

.tr[
--- Madison, *Federalist* #10 

"The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection"
]
]

???

Remove the causes of faction
+ Destroying liberty
+ Creating a society homogeneous in opinions and interests


Faction and Prevent Faction (?)


---

## When Removing Is Inappropriate

Control "only working in a republic"

+ A .blue[large] one (diverse interest groups)
+ Under federalism (making .red[local] matter)

Not fit pure democracy:
+ Only the representatives can construct common interests (Madison).

???

The principle of popular sovereignty should prevent minority factions from gaining power.

The government plays an active role in establishing the conditions for interest groups to act.

## Truman's Interest Group


### Interest groups' strategic position
+ Status & prestige
+ Standing against the rule
+ Government membersion in the group
+ Usefulness as a source of information

--

### Interest groups's internal characteristics
+ Degree of organization
+ Skills of the leadership
+ Resources/money

### Governmental Institutions
+ Operating structure
+ Groups' effects on particular branches of the government

+ Interest groups' .blue[characteristics] influence governmental decisions. 
+ Diversity makes policy-making .blue[flexible].


???

The interest groups' **strategic position** in the society (groups' status and prestige; their standing against the rules of the game; government membership in these groups; their usefulness as a source of information) and **internal characteristics** of both the interest groups (degree of organization; the skills of the leadership; and resources/money) and **governmental institutions** (operating structure; groups' effects on particular branches of the government) affect the influence on governmental decisions.  
The political structure of the U.S. government (federalism, liberty, rights) allows potential interest groups to rise and therefore play a role in representing interests.  
Diversity and will accommodate policy-making and will make it more flexible.

## Goods

???

A more general view beyond politics (just like neo-institutionalism over institutionalism)

Olson's Collective Action

Private: Software?  
Club: Water network?  
Common: Freshwater?  
Public: Dam?

## Olson's Collective Action Problem: Free Rider

???

Everyone has an intention not to contribute

See also Garrett Hardin' s tragedy of the commons

a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action.
