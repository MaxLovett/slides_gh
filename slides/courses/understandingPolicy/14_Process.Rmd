+ Content:
    + Intro of the targeted policy (Why should we care?)
    + Theory and hypothesis (What's your OV & EV and how are they connected)
    + Method and data (How do you test your theory?)
    + Operation (Can you actually do it?)
+ Questions (Randomly drawing a challenger)

## Example: English Recognition in Singapore

Why did English become a recognized official language in the Singaporean language policy?


Esp. given there were only 21% of the population spoke this language when the country was independent.

### Step 1: Identify Hypotheses

State (institutional) capacity  

vs.

Prioritization of the education ministry

???

Goh Keng Swee (吴庆瑞): 财政部长、内政及国防部长、副总理, 奠定了新加坡教育的精英主义政策, 取得伦敦政经学院经济学博士学位。

The Goh Report identified and set out recommendations to address three shortcomings: high education wastage, low literacy, and ineffective bilingualism. English was taught to maximize proficiency

### Step 2: Establish Time Line


???

1. The very second step right after determining the DV
1. Before the evidence collection

### Step 3: Construct Causal Graph

<img src="images/process_causalEnglish.jpg" height = 500 />

???

Causal process of X &rarr; Y  
Used to identify relevant moments and actors that could affect the results.

class: center, middle

### Step 4, 5: Identify Alternative Choice or Event and Counterfactual Outcomes

Counterfactual 1: Weak State &rarr; language of the dominant population.

Counterfactual 2: Leed did not assign Goh as the MOE &rarr; the status quo.

???

A reason that choices might make differences  
If there's no comparative cases, then conterfactual outcomes.

How to find the evidence?

## Terminology of Evidence

*Necessary* & *sufficient* conditions/statments

When A is a .magenta[sufficient] condition of B, then once A happens, B must happen.  
When A is a .magenta[necessary] condition of B, then there must be A for B to happen.

## Practice

+ Being 2, 4, 6, or 8 is __ for being an even natural integer.
+ Being 2, 4, 6, or 8 is __ for being an even natural integer <10.

--

+ Being highly intelligent is __ for being a student of Tsinghua.
+ Showing up to class is __ for getting an A.
+ Being mortal is __ for being human.
+ Being a rational animal is __ for being human.

柯南：幸级呲 哇 一次摸 hi 拖呲

1. Hoop test: no alibi, the accused in the state when murder happens? If not innocent, but passing does not mean being guilty. 《顶楼》中女孩儿死时最上面女主在现场，但并不代表就是她造成的女孩儿的死亡（虽然其实是）
1. Smoking-gun test: a smoking gun seen in a suspect's hand moments after a shooting is quite conclusive proof of guilt, but a suspect not seen with a smoking gun is not proven innocent. 途中确实是收费人员不动，但司机之前戏耍收费人员在先
1. Double-decisive test: hoop + smoking-gun, like a camera record 柯南说是就是
1. Straw-in-the-wind test: Richard Liu seemed friendly with the girl. 之前女主挽着Richard上电梯，并不代表之后不存在sexual harassment或rape

Procedure:

1. Size: 5--15
1. Subjects read or watch something.
1. Researcher ask the questions.
1. Subjects express the feelings and opinions.
