## Overview

1. Origin
1. Components
1. Logic
1. Dynamics
1. Criticism
1. Bonus...

---

## A Theory Appearing in A Variety of Areas

+ Biology
+ Sociology
+ Anthropology
+ Political Science (public administration)

???

Sociology: Emile [ei'mi:l] Durkheim [ˈdɜːkhaɪm], 涂尔干

---

### Classic Perspective of Policy Making

+ Popular since 1960s
    + Political development in newly independent countries 

???

The approaches for the U.S. and European politics didn't work for new countries

Almond, Gabriel Abraham, and James Smoot Coleman. 1960. The Politics of the Developing Areas. Princeton University Press.

## Objective

.center[.red[Political System]]

.center[<img src="images/sys_politicalSystem.png" height = 300 />]


What's in the "box"?  FUNCTION! (What's that?)

???

what does a structure (guerrilla movement, political party, election, etc.) do within the political system (of country x)? 

---

## Components

.huge[System]

???

1. The connection of structures
1. Conversion process, basic pattern maintenance, and various capabilities (distributive, symbolic, etc.)
1. Developing countries have a simpler system, and developed have a complex one, but both have structures with SIMILAR functions.

--

.center[.Large[&rarr; Structures]]

???

political party, legislature, executive, judiciary, interest group, officials

--


.right-column[
&rarr; Functions
+ Input
+ Output (Aha!)
]

???

1. Economic terms
1. Input: political socialization & recruitment, interest articulation/aggregation, and political communication
1. Output: rule-making, rule implementation/adjudication
1. Different structures may perform others' function: executive has legislature functions (部门立法)

---

.Large[System]
.center[.large[&rarr; Structures]]
.pull-right[
&rarr; Functions
+ Input
+ Output (Aha!)
]

.Large[Environment]

+ International
+ Domestic (culture)
    + Elite (e.g., expansive, exclusive, closed, parochial, synthetic, null)
    + Elite-mass interactions

???

What does environment mean in the system theory

Pye: China  
Weinter: mass demands and elites' strategies

---

## Focus

Consequences &larr; Actors' importance &larr; Actors' functions & performances

--

.center[System &harr; Actors (David Easton 1957)]

## Logic

---

.center[
<img src="images/fun_structuralFunctionalism.png" height = 350 />
<img src="images/sys_politicalSystem.png" height = 250 />
]

???

There's time, no development in political system

---

## Political Development

1. Penetration (elites &rarr; masses)
1. Commitment (elites &larr; masses)
1. Participation (elites &harr; masses)
1. Distribution (elites &rarr; masses)

???

Penetration: Whether political elites can get what they want from people over whom they seek to exercise power (Joseph LaPalombara, poli sci Yale)

--

.center[.red[Interaction w. environments]]

---

## System Change

*Inevitable*

+ ~~State~~ Political system: Openness

--

+ Challenges from the environments  
&rarr; adaptions and adjustment

--

+ Stability bias &rarr; Conservative, evolutionary changes

---

## Motivations of Changes

Elites and their associates

Social groups 

System's own demands

---

## Criticisms

What issues do you find?

--

1. Concept stretching: e.g., system, interactions

???
From anthropology.  
Giovanni Satori, David Collier

--

1. Actor exclusion

???
Only a mere number of structures

--

1. Normative bias

???
Pro-capitalism

--

1. "A theory about social wholes as social wholes"?

# Structural Functionalism in Practice

---

## Operationalizing Structural Functionalism

Using a microanalytic, individualistic perspective

--

1. Actors
1. Goal
1. Interests
1. Interaction

---

class: middle

> .large[Where rational choice theory wants to simplify, the micro-version of structural-functionalism calls for enrichment.  
---Lane (1994: 466)]

---

## Actors

The actors are .blue[groups]: 

1. Elites
1. Masses
1. Governments

--

.center[*Does individuals enter the picture?*]

???
How? As leaders 

---

## Goals 

Actors have .blue[fixed] preference orders and move .red[strategically] to .blue[maximize] their interests.

--

&rArr; Social equilbiria

--

Changes, developments, and all sorts of politics

---

## what Constructs Interests?

Economics: Utility function  
Poli sci/sociologist: Non-universal, narrow, monetary

Structural-functionalism: political culture

???

Pye: Elites behave differently in different countries and circumstances

民主党（Union, LGBTQ, environmentalists） vs. 共和党

---

## Micro &rarr; Macro (Individual &rarr; System)

I. Each actor evaluates goals and opportunities &rarr; conform/fight

???
conform: following the existing rule

--

II. Game
+ All actor conform &rarr; system stable
+ Fighter vs. conformer &rarr; fighter wins
+ Fighter vs. fighter &rarr; "Stronger" wins

--

III. Winners rerule the system

--

IV. The process repeats in the new system.

---

## Contribution of Structural Functionalism

Bring the .blue[variety] and .blue[variance] in:

1. Varieties of the institutions, leaders, social configurations
1. Variances in space and time

---

## Taking-Home Points

1. Structural functionalism
    + Environment
    + System
    + Structure
1. From micro perspective: actor as groups
    + Elites
    + Masses
    + Government
    + Interests
    + Function
