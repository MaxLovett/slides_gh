    + Political development in newly independent countries

The approaches for the U.S. and European politics didn't work for new countries

Political party,    
legislature,    
executive,    
judiciary,    
interest group,     
governmental officials   
election,     
guerrilla movement,

what does a structure (guerrilla movement, political party, election, etc.) do within the political system (of country x)? 

---

## Components

A political system: a kind of .red[interdependence] between the parts and a kind of .red[boundary] between the system and the environment.

- The basic unit of a system is the structure of role combination
    - *Organizations and institutions* that maintain or change political structure.

- Interacts with the domestic and foreign environment

- A process of input and output


???

1. The connection of structures
1. Conversion process, basic pattern maintenance, and various capabilities (distributive, symbolic, etc.)
1. Developing countries have a simpler system, and developed have a complex one, but both have structures with SIMILAR functions.


???

1. Economic terms
1. Input: political socialization & recruitment, interest articulation/aggregation, and political communication
1. Output: rule-making, rule implementation/adjudication
1. Different structures may perform others' function: executive has legislature functions (部门立法)

## Functions (of Structures)

.pull-left[
*System function*

Maintaining or changing political structure
- political socialization
- political recruitment
- political communication
]

.pull-right[
*Process function*

The processing process of political requirement by political system 
- interest expression
- interest synthesis
- law and decision making
]

.center[
*Policy function*

Mainly reflected in this process function. 
- The public, consumer organizations and trade unions' demands for their own interests are finally reflected in the policy process through
the integration of the government.

## Assumptions

Political structures are .red[universal]

Political functions are .red[universal]

A political structure functions in .red[many] ways

There's time, no development in political system

## Political Development

1. Penetration (elites &rarr; masses)
1. Commitment (elites &larr; masses)
1. Participation (elites &harr; masses)
1. Distribution (elites &rarr; masses)



Penetration: Whether political elites can get what they want from people over whom they seek to exercise power (Joseph LaPalombara, poli sci Yale)

Interaction w. environments

## System Change

+ Challenges from the environments  
&rarr; adaptions and adjustment

+ Stability bias &rarr; Conservative, evolutionary changes
]

.pull-right[
*Source*

Elites and their associates

Social groups 

System's own demands

## Criticisms

1. Concept stretching: e.g., system, interactions

???
From anthropology.  
Giovanni Satori, David Collier

--

1. Actor exclusion

???
Only a mere number of structures

--

1. Normative bias

???
Pro-capitalism

--

1. "A theory about social wholes as social wholes"?

## Punctuated Equilibrium (PE)

.pull-left[
**Equilibrium**

???

单脚独立练习

--

.pull-right[
**Stasis**    
A long period of relatively unchanged form

**Punctuation**   
Radical changes over a short duration

**Dominant relative frequency**
The rate these events occur in a particular situation

]

**Deep structure**    
The set of fundamental ".red[choices]" a system has made of (1) the basic .blue[parts] into which its units will be organized and (2) the basic .blue[activity patterns] that will maintain its existence.

--

**Equilibrium periods**
The maintenance of organizational structures and activity patterns, where .red[small incremental adjustments] are made to adjust for environmental changes .blue[without affecting] the deep structure.

--

**Revolutionary periods** 
Occurring due to significant changes in the environment that lead to .red[wholesale upheaval] where a system's deep structure comes apart, leaving it in disarray .blue[until] the period ends and choices are made around which a new structure forms.


C.f. "sequential rationality"

???

Explain the policy changes and institutional changes in a more dynamic way


---

## Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF)

**Policy actors**: Boundedly rational.

**Normative beliefs** must be .red[empirically ascertained] and does not a priori preclude the possibility of altruistic behavior.

**Policy Subsystems**   
- The primary unit of analysis to understand policy processes. 
- Characterized by a geographical area, an issue, and policy actors.
- Subsystems aggregate actors into one or more coalitions.

---

## Political Process in the View of ACF<sup>*</sup>

.pull-left[

**Advocacy Coalition**    
All those defined by political actors who .red[share beliefs] coordinate among themselves in a functional way to .blue[suggest specific issues] to the government and influence in the decision-making process.

- Deep core beliefs
- Policy core beliefs
- Secondary beliefs

- Beliefs in
- Multiple feedback mechanisms are summarized

JLA v3

- deep core beliefs: span most policy
subsystems. involve very general normative and ontological assumptions about human nature, the relative priority of fundamental values such as liberty and equality and so on.
    - 蝙蝠侠不信任所有英雄
- policy core beliefs: span an entire policy subsystem. eleven components of policy core beliefs
    - 为每个应英雄设置对应策略
- secondary beliefs:relatively narrow in scope (less than subsystem-wide) and address.
    - 屯氪石


---

## New institutionalism

**Institutions**    
1. The procedure and mechanism of policy formation
    - Policy: the the result of system operation
1. The rule of policy implementation
    - The tool and means of policy implementation

--

**Streams**

- Rational choice Institutionalism: Develop the game theory by incorporating institutional structure into the .red[strategy set ]of decision-makers.

???

Politics as a series of collective action dilemmas

--

- Sociological Institutionalism: Individuals embedded in "cultural background or institutional environment" are not only limited in their choices, but also influenced by .red[cultural factors] through norms or cognition.

???

Cultural legitimacy

--

- Historical Institutionalism: Analyzes institutional change with the sequence of events in the .red[long period of history].

???

Middle road, combining the above two
