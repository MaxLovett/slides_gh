## Overview

1. What's a system?
1. Why a system?
1. How to understand a system?

---

## What's a System?

.center[<img src="images/sys_computerSystem.png" height = 550 />]

???

ALU: Arithmetic logic unit


---

## Why System?

--

To integrate? Nope!

> The very idea of a system suggests that we can .red[separate] political life from the rest of social activity.  
---David Easton (1957: 384)

???

At least for an analytic purpose

---

## How to Separate a System from Others

### Criteria

1. Unites (roles)
1. .gray[Boundaries]

???

e.g.,

1. Human system vs. international system
1. Biological system vs. chemical system

> This study had two purposes. .blue[First], it empirically examined the relationship between citizens' participation in administrative policymaking phases and their perception of government transparency. .blue[Second], it investigated how citizens' use of both offline and online participation channels and their involvement in different phases of policymaking (i.e., agenda setting, implementation, and evaluation) were related to their assessment of transparency in government. .blue[A 2009 survey] of residents of Seoul, South Korea, was used to test the study hypotheses. Using two‐stage least squares estimate techniques, the study .blue[found] that citizens involved in any citizen participation programs are more likely than those not involved to positively assess transparency in government. With regard to the relationship between participation channels and transparency, citizens who used offline participation channels were more likely than nonusers to perceive enhanced transparency in local government.
