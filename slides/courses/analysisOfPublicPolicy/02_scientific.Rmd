# Scientific, Huh

## A Story

Somehow in the Internet, there a rumor that a Doc in traditional medicine told a [story](http://szyyj.gd.gov.cn/zyyfw/ysbj/content/post_2541293.html) about drinking water. 

---

> 每天早晨喝一杯凉水，是一个错误的养生做法……[The Doc said]他是偶然发现这个问题的，当时他在给一位女士调理身体，本来调理得很好……突然有一天，再诊脉的时候，发现她的舌质又淡白了，舌体胖大，病情反复，忙问这是怎么回事儿？她回答，半个月前，看到电视里面有养生专家让晨起喝凉水，于是坚持了这些天，已经腹泻了很多次了。这么样，损失了阳气，导致水湿重。有位中医也被这一说法骗了……最后竟然收集了几百例的病例，都是晨起喝凉水，导致的各种复杂古怪的病症的。

## Ok, Let's Decompose It

*Problem* 

"给一位女士调理身体，本来调理得很好……突然有一天，再诊脉的时候，发现她的舌质又淡白了，舌体胖大，病情反复"

--

*Theory*

"损失了阳气，导致水湿重"

--

*Evidence*

"晨起喝凉水，于是坚持了这些天，已经腹泻了很多次了"

--

*Conclusion*

"每天早晨喝一杯凉水，是一个错误的养生做法"

## Why's The Story Convincing?

]

## In Epistemology?

+ Inquiry
    + Direct Observation
    + Agreement reality
        + Those we "know" as part and parcel of the culture we share with those around us

---

## What's the Problem?

Another Example: There was a eclipse in 2017

So, was the POTUS idiot?

## Well...

## Flaws of Human Inquiries?

Selection observation  
Inaccurate observation  
Overgeneralization  
Illogical reasoning  
......

What should we do?

## Scientific Data Collection and Analyses

### Analysis

---

## Being Scientific?

What does "scientific" even mean?

--

.center[<img src="images/phiSci.png" height = 400 />]

---

## Why Being Scientific?

'cause data alone is not enough~ 

1. Where to find data?
1. How data are legit?
1. How to make sense of data?

--

Conducting credible analyses

Assumption + Theory &rarr; Method + Data &rarr; Conclusion

## Well, Be Scientific?

Being scientific is (perhaps) not the only goal!

## Esp. in Policy Analysis

*The Law of Decreasing Credibility*

The credibility of inference .magenta[decreases] with the .magenta[strength] of the assumptions maintained.

--

But in practice, 

Credibility vs. Strong conclusions?



---

## An Example Among others

Congressional Budget Office & Joint Committee on Taxation:

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
Reconciliation Act

> CBO and JCT estimate that enacting both pieces of legislation...would produce a .magenta[net reduction] of changes in federal deficits of .magenta[$138 billion] over the 2010–-2019 period as a result of changes in direct spending and revenue.


???

Predictions that are generally accepted as true, but that are not necessarily true.
Douglas Elmendorf: dean and Don K. Price Professor of Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School

## Consequences

Conventional certitude:

Impartial CBO & ignored uncertainty

> All such estimates are uncertain and that actual future impacts could differ significantly from the estimates of any given organization.--- U.S. Dep of Health and Human Services

???

On a separate estimation of the health care legislation

## Uncertainty/Alternative Assumptions

Douglas Holtz-Eakin: 

> The health care reform legislation would .magenta[raise], not lower, federal deficits, by .magenta [$562 billion].

Difference: **138+562 (700)** billion

## Why Ignoring?

> You can’t give the client a bound. The client needs a point.
