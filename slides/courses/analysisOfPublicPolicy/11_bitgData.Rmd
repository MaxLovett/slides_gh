# `Big-Data` Analysis

---

## What's Big Data?

> Data sets characterized by huge amounts<sup>1</sup> of frequently updated<sup>2</sup> data in various formats<sup>3</sup>, such as numeric, textual, or images/videos.<sup>4</sup>  

--

[1] Volumn  
[2] Velocity  
[3] Variety

[4] Two more "v"s: veracity and value

???

veracity: accuracy, integrity (how do you know?)  
value: how much value for each unit of data?

---

## Big Data for Policy Analysis

Volumn: Probably more than Excel and SPSS;  

--

Velocity: More relate to commercial, but also the information background setting of policy implementation;  

--

Variety: statistical techniques + social-science ideas

## Issues about Big-Data Based Analysis

1. How "big" is big?
1. What's new?
1. Where are they from?
1. How do we understand?
1. Is it correct?
