## Opening a new document in Word, or take a blank sheet

--

Writing down the "creative" point (you think) of the paper

--

Start writing the outline:

- Figures and tables

--

- Bullet points of each section

--

.pull-right[
- Basic frame
    + Introduction
    + Literature Review

*Analysis and Results*
.center[Setup the major findings]

*Reference*


---

## Method and Data 

Starting from the easiest section

--

- Detailed to be replicable

- Lean (.red[NOT] copy) on *good* papers
    - See what similar papers do and copy that (not plagiarism, of course)

???

Refer to Dr. Lucy Foulkes (Pyschology, UCL) writing workshop

## Analysis and Results

- Literature: What we already know

--

- Theory: Your idea to solve the problem

--

- Hypotheses/research focus
    - Naming them (and referring to them since the intro)
    - **Help your readers!**

---

## Conclusion

Summary: What you've done and found

--

 Implications: Interpretations with links back to predictions and past research

Limitations & future directions

## Introduction

Start broad at the beginning 
- What general phenomenon/puzzle/theory do you focus on?

--

More specification about your study

## Tips

- One thing a paragraph

--

- First sentence leading the paragraph
    - The single point you are making here

--

- Short sentence is great.

# Wording Advice
## 3 hrs ~ 0.5 d

---

## Clarity

+ Make main characters subjects.

--

+ Make important actions verbs
    + Reduce nominalization of verbs.

???
e.g., globalization

--

+ When to use nominalization:
    + As a short subject refers to a previous sentence
    + As a motivation ("the fact that" sb. does sth).
    + As the object of the verb
    + A concept so familiar to your readers

???

+ The nominalization as a short subject refers to a previous sentence (e.g., these arguments, this decision.)
+ The nominalization refers to "the fact that" sb. does sth.
+ A nominalization names what would be the OBJECT of the verb, the "what" or "whom" of the verb.
+ A nominalization refers to a concept so familiar to your readers that to them, it is a virtual character

---

## Coherence

+ Underline the .red[first five or six words] in every sentence, and check if they constitute a relatively .red[small set] of related ideas and if they name the most important characters.

--

+ Use the .red[topic as the subject], and put them at the beginning of the sentences.

--

+ .red[Don't vary] the subjects of the sentences frequently

???

Change a little only when the same words for the same topic were times used in the same positions of sentences.

--

+ .red[Don't overuse] "and, also, moreover, another, and so on", words that simply "Here's one more thing."

--

+ .red[Don't use] "but, however, therefore, or consequently" too frequently.

---

## Elegence

* Revise long sentence
    + Get to the subject of the main clause quickly
    + Get to the verb and object quickly
    + Avoid sprawls (which, that, who + is/was)
    + Drop "although" with a long clause
    + Drop "since" with a long clause

--

* Balance
    + with coordination (and, or, nor, but, and yet)
    + without coordination but with similarly structure in each clause.

--

* Climactic Emphasis: leave heavy words at the end
    + Heavy: n. > a./ad. > prep.

If your supervisor covers your work in tracked changes & comments, it's a sign .red[they care]. Being edited feels personal and painful (I hate it!), but it’s the best way you become a better writer. If they send you back something with no edits, that’s when you should worry.
