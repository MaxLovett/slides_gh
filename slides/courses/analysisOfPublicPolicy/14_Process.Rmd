Goal : Theory testing

Hypothesis: Explanation rivalry

## Example: English Recognition in Singapore

.small[Why did English become a recognized official language in the Singaporean language policy, esp. given there were only 21% of the population spoke this language when the country was independent?]

### Step 1: Identify Hypotheses

H<sub>0</sub>: State (institutional) capacity  
H<sub>1</sub>: Prioritization of the education ministry

???

Goh Keng Swee (吴庆瑞): 财政部长、内政及国防部长、副总理, 奠定了新加坡教育的精英主义政策, 取得伦敦政经学院经济学博士学位。

The Goh Report identified and set out recommendations to address three shortcomings: high education wastage, low literacy, and ineffective bilingualism. English was taught to maximize proficiency

### Step 2: Establish Time Line


???

1. The very second step right after determining the DV
1. Before the evidence collection

---

### Step 3: Construct Causal Graph

.center[<img src="images/causalEnglish.jpg" height = 500 />]

???

Causal process of X &rarr; Y  
Used to identify relevant moments and actors that could affect the results.

---

### Step 4: Identify Alternative Choice or Event
### Step 5: Identify Counterfactual Outcomes

Counterfactual 1: Weak State &rarr; language of the dominant population language.

Counterfactual 2: Leed did not assign Goh as the MOE &rarr; the status quo.

???

A reason that choices might make differences  
If there's no comparative cases, then conterfactual outcomes.

### Step 6: Find Evidence for Primary Hypothesis

| .small[Necessity\\Sufficiency]<sup>&midast;</sup> | Yes             | No                |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Yes                   | Double-Decisive | Smoking Gun       |
| No                    | Hoop            | Straw-in-the-Wind |

.footnote[
[&midast;] Evera, Stephen Van. 1997. *Guide to Methods for Students of Political Science*. Ithaca: Cornell University Press.
]

???

1. Hoop test: no alibi, the accused in the state when murder happens? If not innocent, but passing does not mean being guilty.
1. Smoking-gun test: a smoking gun seen in a suspect's hand moments after a shooting is quite conclusive proof of guilt, but a suspect not seen with a smoking gun is not proven innocent.
1. Double-decisive test: hoop + smoking-gun, like a camera record
1. Straw-in-the-wind test: Richard Liu seemed friendly with the girl.

The primary hypothesis failed the hoop test: when recognition happened, the state was not a strong state

## Interview

.center[<img src="images/interview.jpg" height = 300 />]

### Procedure

Strategic communication (guiding and listening)

---

.left-column[
### Outcome: 
+ Open answers
+ Messy details
+ Contradictory points
]  

--

.right-co[
### Technique
+ Safe environment
+ More listening, less talking
+ Design the interview strategy + pilots
]

--

### Be Prepared...

class: small

## Interview 2.0: Focus Group

Procedure:

1. Size: 5--15
1. Subjects read or watch something.
1. Researcher ask the questions.
1. Subjects express the feelings and opinions.

.center[<img src="images/focusGroup.png" height = 350 />]

???

Brexit: Uncivil War

---


### Pros:

1. Real-life environment
1. Flexibility
1. Low cost


--

### Cons:

1. Non-privacy-protection
1. Who lead the talk?
1. No SUTVA
1. Selection interviewees

---

## Content analysis

.center[<img src="images/closeReading.jpg" height = 480 />]

---

## Step 1: Content Sampling

* Terminology:
    + Content analysis: 100 and below
    + Text analysis: above 100 (usually above 1,000)
    + Unit of analysis?

--
    
* Sampling technique
    + Convenient sample
    + Stratification
    + Clustering

---

## Step 2: Coding

* Manifest content
* Latent content
* Online assistance: [CATMA](http://catma.de/) or eMargin

---

## Example with CATMA

## Step 3 Analysis

Not much different from other interpretive methods

1. Context analysis
1. Transparency
1. Transferability

]

---

### Pros

* Economy
* Allowing correction
* Overtime survey
* Third party

--

### Cons

* Limited content
* Limited scale
* Subjective consistency
