## Operating a Process Tracing

Goal : Theory testing

Hypothesis: Examining explanation rivalries

Operation:

## Example: English Recognition in Singapore

Theoretical question:
- Language recognition

Empirical puzzle:
- English is an official language of Singapore, but only **21% of the population** spoke this language when the country was independent.

Goh Keng Swee (吴庆瑞): 财政部长、内政及国防部长、副总理, 奠定了新加坡教育的精英主义政策, 取得伦敦政经学院经济学博士学位。

The Goh Report identified and set out recommendations to address three shortcomings: high education wastage, low literacy, and ineffective bilingualism. English was taught to maximize proficiency

## Step 2: Establish Time Line

1. The very second step right after determining the DV
1. Before the evidence collection

## Step 3: Construct Causal Graph

???

Causal process of X &rarr; Y  
Used to identify relevant moments and actors that could affect the results.

## Step 4: Identify Alternative Choice or Event
## Step 5: Identify Counterfactual Outcomes

Counterfactual 1: Weak State &rarr; language of the dominant population language.

Counterfactual 2: Leed did not assign Goh as the MOE &rarr; the status quo.

???

A reason that choices might make differences  
If there's no comparative cases, then conterfactual outcomes.

1. Hoop test: no alibi, the accused in the state when murder happens? If not innocent, but passing does not mean being guilty.
1. Smoking-gun test: a smoking gun seen in a suspect's hand moments after a shooting is quite conclusive proof of guilt, but a suspect not seen with a smoking gun is not proven innocent.
1. Double-decisive test: hoop + smoking-gun, like a camera record
1. Straw-in-the-wind test: Richard Liu seemed friendly with the girl.

## Content/Discourse Analysis

.center[<img src="images/closeReading.jpg" height = 480 />]

---

## Step 1: Content Sampling

* Terminology:
    + Content analysis: 100 and below
    + Text analysis: above 100 (usually above 1,000)
    + Unit of analysis?

--
    
* Sampling technique
    + Convenient sample
    + Stratification
    + Clustering

--

## Step 2: Coding

* Manifest content
* Latent content
* Online assistance: [CATMA](http://catma.de/) or eMargin

---

## Example with CATMA

## Step 3 Analysis

Not much different from other interpretive methods

1. Context
1. Transparency
1. Transferability

.pull-left[
### Pros

* Economic
* Allowing correction
* Overtime survey
* Third party
]

.pull-right[
### Cons

* Limited content
* Limited scale
* Subjective consistency
