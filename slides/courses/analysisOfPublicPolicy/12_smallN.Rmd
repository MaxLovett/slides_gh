# Small-N Approach

---

## In Previous Episode...

+ Large-N Approach
    + Survey
    + "Big-Data" approach
    
+ Criteria
    + Internal, External, Ecological Validities

--

What's small-N approach (SNA)?

---

## SNA 1: Value Judging

.left-column[
<img src="images/essenceOfDecision.jpg" />
]

.right-column[
+ Identifying "communities of meaning"
+ Studying the framing and interactions among the communities
]

---

## SNA 2: Story Telling

.left-column[Telling stories about a certain group or policy based on archives and interviews]

--

.right-column[<img src="images/bigRig.jpg" />]

???

Political sociologist, UPenn

Viscelli, Steve. 2016. The Big Rig: Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream. First edition. Oakland, California: University of California Press.


---

## SNA 3: Narrative Analysis

Going beyond telling a story

Using story to .magenta[make an argument]

Putting an argument in the .magenta[thick context]

---

## SNA 4: Dramaturgical Analysis

How do policy and policy makers "act"?

.left-column[
+ "Actors"
+ "Content"
+ "Theme"
+ "Space"
]

--

.right-column[
<img src="images/theoVanGogh.jpg" />
]

???

Dutch film actor Theo van Gogh was assassinated by a Dutch-Moroccan Muslim wo ojbected to the director's movie Submission that critcized the treatment of women in Islam.

---

## SNA 5: Category Analysis

+ Identity: Welfare recipients, official language...

--

+ Levels: Comprehensive strategic partners, strategic and cooperative partners, strategic partners, constructive cooperative partners...

???
Strüver, Georg. 2017. “China’s Partnership Diplomacy: International Alignment Based on Interests or Ideology.” The Chinese Journal of International Politics 10(1): 31–65.

--

+ Direction: Smart city, service-oriented government, neo-urbanization...

---

## So, How Small Is Small?

Some SNA included one case; some compared a couple of cases; and some anaylsed several hundreds of documents...

--

While some large-N studies also focuses on one, a pair, or several hundreds.

---

## Why Small?

.left-column[

### Hey, LNA guys...

+ Distance? 
+ Context?
+ Value (of researchers)?
]

.right-column[
<img src="images/chaPing.jpg" />

The real world is very complex, dude~

---

## What Do SNA Researchers Do?

+ Role
+ Data collection
+ Analysis

---

### Role

1. Researchers are human
    + Experiences
    + Cognitive differences
    
???

Cognitive differences: men and women; allowing tourists entering the campus

--

1. Researchers have value

--

1. Researchers participate
    + Observer vs. Insider
    + Undercover vs. Activist

???

Researchers generalize/create culture, etc.

---

### Data Collection

Observing .magenta[with intention to understand]

.center[<img src="images/smallRoomManyPeople.large" height = 400 />]

???

Understand acts and actors 
1. as much as possible 
2.from within their own frame of reference, their own sense-making of the situation

Pader, Ellen-J. 1994. “Spatial Relations and Housing Policy: Regulations That Discriminate Against Mexican-Origin Households.” Journal of Planning Education and Research 13(2): 119–35.

Using American view of occupancy (and thus housing policy enforcement) is discriminated.

---

Interviewing with respondents as .magenta[conversational partner]

.center[<img src="images/wingman.jpg" height = 400 />]

???

Schaffer, Frederic Charles. 2000. Democracy in Translation: Understanding Politics in an Unfamiliar Culture. Cornell University Press.

Interview of people in Senegal about democracy and American democracy

---

Reading the documents as they were writing .magenta[meaningfully].

Rule by law vs. rule of law

"闻诛一夫纣矣，未闻弑君也" (《孟子·梁惠王章句下·第八》)


???

Chock, Phyllis Pease. 1995. “Ambiguity in Policy Discourse: Congressional Talk about Immigration.” Policy Sciences 28(2): 165–84.

By examining the written record of spoken language, she was able to analyze the ways in which legislators’ and expert witnesses’ embedded ideas about immigrants refl ected and shaped immigration reform and policy contentions.

---

### Analysis

"No need to transform words into numbers"

+ Numbers are not the results but the sources

--

+ More details than digits

???

Narrative reports often read like novels.

--

+ Where did the number or whatever data come from?

--

+ Where to find the data, what are data, how to know what are saying in the data?...

???

Analysis and collection are intertwined.

---

## Evaluating SNA

.left-column[

~~Be objective~~

Reality is universal;
Policy is not constructed.

In large N, implications are clear at least.

]

--

.right-column[

~~Be voiceless~~

<img src="images/Beauvoir.jpg" height = 350 />

]

???

Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex, gender is constructed.

One is not born a woman, but becomes one.

---

.left-column[

~~Be experimental~~

The SNA assumes impacts and multicausality are data and useful.

]

--

.right-column[
~~Be replicated~~

<img src="images/twins.gif" height = 300 />

]

---

~~Be generalized~~

.center[<img src="images/yangQihan.jpg" height = 500 />]

---

## A Different Paradigm

Philosophically, epistemologically, and ideologically

+ Perfect validity is impossible
+ The society is constructed
+ Data do not talk, researchers do


???

researchers interpret data
researchers generalize conclusions

---

## Novel Evaluation System

+ Credibility
+ Transferability
+ Dependability
+ Confirmability

---

### Credibility

If the data and implications are presented credibly.

.center[<img src="images/zhiLuWeiMa.png" height = 400 />]

???

Based on enough description

---

### Transferability

> 当年的SARS也属于冠状病毒，公众容易将二者相类比。当年在应对SARS的过程中，我们是有过教训的。这就提醒我们，千万不可产生轻敌心态和麻痹思想，更不能犯下和当年一样的错误。  
---"尽快掐灭疫情传播的'火种'"《人民日报客户端》（2020-01-22）

--

Readers' call, though.

???

a result of detailed, illustrative description, and the responsibility shifts from the researcher (the sender) to individuals in other settings (the receivers)

https://wap.peopleapp.com/article/5060699/4954813

---

### Dependability

Legit process of inquiry

+ What kinds of data have been collected and over what period of time? 
+ Was the research collected over a determined period of time, or was it simply a rushed study where one visit and a few interviews occurred?  
...

---

### Confirmability

Findings be clearly linked to analysis, data, and the research site.

.center[<img src="images/rumor.jpg" height = 400 />]

???

There's an alternative set of criteria which is more philosophical,

Morrow, Susan L. 2005. “Quality and Trustworthiness in Qualitative Research in Counseling Psychology.” Journal of Counseling Psychology 52(2): 250–60.

---

## How Can You Tell

+ Description
+ Transparency
+ Transferability
+ Authenticity
+ Presentation
+ .magenta[Interpretation]


???

+ Description: detail, Clifford Geertz's thick description 
+ Transparency: researchers' standpoint, data collection
+ Transferability: connection to readers and the society, provoke conversations and debates rather than conclusion
+ Authenticity: showing the interviewees are involved in the question set, a view from their own, such as not lens of badness when studying sex harassment
+ Presentation: writing style, philosophy and history
+ Interpretation: alternatives (indicator of the strength of the quality), more than one, and why yours is the best.

## SNA vs. LNA

| LNA           | SNA           |
|---------------|---------------|
| Objective     | Understanding |
| Voiceless     | Voice         |
| Experimental  | Comparison    |
| Replicable    | Depth         |
| Generalizable | Context       |

Always care about the framing and understanding an issue from different angles.

???

+ Understanding: the researchers' background, view, approach, and value; 钟南山更可信
+ Voice: Study by Bourgois and Schonberg (2009) of homeless men and women who were addicted to drugs is compelling because it showed they care.
+ Comparison: reflexivity: Well-crafted studies provide the reader an opportunity to reflect on his or own situations in regard to similarities and differences.
+ Depth: richesness for understanding and context differences
+ Context: not only if policy works, but what cases not and why

## Take-Home Points

SNA is a different world
