这些人……我想通过这本书来记录这些陌生人的状态，以及每天生活在城市里，他们和我们之间会有什么样的交集，这样一种交集也是跟“真实的附近”产生亲密的关系，看到真实附近里具象的人是紧密联系在一起。真正的陌生人不会是完全和我们没有任何交集的。

《耳朵大有福》（英文譯名：Lucky Dog）是一部2008年由中國和韓國合作拍攝的華語劇情片，是電影導演張猛的故事片處女作，也是其「東北三部曲」中的首部[1]，由范偉主演，講述了一位東北鐵路工人退休之後第一天的生活。影片在第11屆上海國際電影節上獲得了亞洲新人獎評委會特別獎。

在中國東北某小城鐵路局機務段修了四十多年火車的王抗美（范偉）迎來了退休的日子。這份「鐵飯碗」雖然不能為他帶來太豐厚的收入，卻一直讓他過著比上不足、比下有餘的生活，更是這位體制內職工在社交圈子中高人一等的資本。沉浸在「光荣退休」的喜悅中，老王最初對隨之而來的收入削減不以為意；然而，退休後的第一天，他就開始切身感受到生活的種種重負：抱病醫院的老伴（程淑波）仍無好轉跡象，每天的飲食起居都是不菲的開支；家境優渥的女婿（田雨）被女兒（賈瑟）撞破偷情，夫妻關係岌岌可危；試圖打零工補貼家用的老王先後探訪擦鞋女工、人力車夫、二人轉戲院老闆，卻接連鎩羽而歸，有一次更是誤入傳銷窩點而遭警察查扣。好強的老王終於被迫低下頭顱，攜禮物向鐵路局工會幹事（張珂）求助，然而又被告知他的氣管病不屬於工傷賠償範疇。這位以「抗美援朝」命名、並一直以曾在鐵路局宣傳隊領唱過《長征組歌》為豪的老工人，卻在舉國紀念長征勝利七十週年之際發現自己的生活已然舉步維艱。心灰意冷的老王要怎樣才能留住自己殘存的榮耀與尊嚴？

# Paradigm Shift: Interpretivist Approach

---

## Naturalism &rarr; Interpretivism

Philosophic roots: 

- From phenomenology to post-structuralism

???
Phenomenology: Edmund Husserl, reject the concept of objective research.
They believe that analyzing daily human behavior can provide one with a greater understanding of nature.

--

- From Discourse theory to Pragmatism

???

Discourse theory: Habermas, Foucault /fu:'kəu/
-  In our daily activities the way we speak and write is shaped by the structures of power in our society, and that because our society is defined by struggle and conflict our discourses reflect and create conflicts. 

Pragmatism: William James, Dewey
Considers words and thought as tools and instruments for prediction, problem solving, and action, and rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality.

The Bouchard-Taylor commission (named for its two co-chairmen), officially the Quebec Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences, was created on 8 February 2007 by Quebec premier Jean Charest. Its mandate was to examine questions related to reasonable accommodation allowed because of cultural or religious differences in Quebec.

The commission was chaired by philosopher Charles Taylor and historian and sociologist Gérard Bouchard.

???

Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in New York City were convinced that the aggressive order-maintenance practices of the New York City Police Department were responsible for the dramatic decrease in crime rates within the city during the 1990s. Police Commissioner William Bratton began translating the theory into practice as the chief of New York City’s transit police from 1990 to 1992. Squads of plainclothes officers were assigned to catch turnstile jumpers, and, as arrests for misdemeanours increased, subway crimes of all kinds decreased dramatically. 

When Bratton resigned in 1996, felonies were down almost 40 percent in New York, and the homicide rate had been halved.
