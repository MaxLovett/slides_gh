# System Theory

---

## When Speaking about System...

.center[&lt;img src="images/system.png" height = 400 /&gt;]

---

## How Does a Computer System Look Like

.center[&lt;img src="images/computerSystem.png" height = 550 /&gt;]

---

## How Does a Political System Look Like

.center[&lt;img src="images/politicalSystem.png" height = 400 /&gt;]

---

## Purpose of the System Theory

--

To integrate?

Nope! To separate!

&gt; The very idea of a system suggests that we can separate political life from the rest of social activity, at least for analytical purpose.---David Easton (1957: 384)

--

Why?

---

## How to Differentiate Systems

### Criteria

1. Unites (roles)
1. Boundaries

## Units of Analysis

Kim, Soonhee, and Jooho Lee. 2019. “Citizen Participation, Process, and Transparency in Local Government: An Exploratory Study.” *Policy Studies Journal* 47(4): 1026–47.


&gt; This study had two purposes. First, it empirically examined the relationship between citizens' participation in administrative policymaking phases and their perception of government transparency. Second, it investigated how citizens' use of both offline and online participation channels and their involvement in different phases of policymaking (i.e., agenda setting, implementation, and evaluation) were related to their assessment of transparency in government. A 2009 survey of residents of Seoul, South Korea, was used to test the study hypotheses. Using two‐stage least squares estimate techniques, the study found that citizens involved in any citizen participation programs are more likely than those not involved to positively assess transparency in government. With regard to the relationship between participation channels and transparency, citizens who used offline participation channels were more likely than nonusers to perceive enhanced transparency in local government. However, their use of online participation channels had limited effect on perceptions of transparency. Finally, participation in two phases of the policy process, agenda setting and evaluation, positively affected citizens' assessment of transparency in government.

## Understanding the System

.center[&lt;img src="images/politicalSystem.png" height = 300 /&gt;]

--

+ Input: Keeping the system going
+ Output: Identifying the consequences
+ Feedback: Adapting and adjusting

---

## Inputs

Environment &amp;rarr; system

--

+ Demands
    + External
    + Internal
+ Support
    + Policy
    + Politicization

---

## Demands

### External

+ Ecology
+ Economy
+ .magenta[Culture]
+ Personality
+ Social structure
+ Demography

---

## Powerful Culture

&gt; [Culture] shapes [social members'] general goals, specific objectives, and the procedures that the members feel ought to be used. 


---

## Culture &amp;rarr; Policy

## Why Demands Matter

1. Material basis of the system
1. Source of system's existence and adjustment

---

## Support

&gt; Energy in the form of actions or orientations promoting and resisting a political system. ---David Easton (157: 390)

--

A supports B, which means...

.left-column[

*Back up*

]

.right-column[

*Intimacy*

&lt;img src="images/fans.jpg" height = 300 /&gt;

]

--

### Objects to show the support

1. Community
1. Regime
1. Government

---

## Support in Political Community

.center[&lt;img src="images/civilWar.jpg" height = 300 /&gt;]


???

The issue turned on whether there was sufficient mutual identification among the members of the system for them to be able to work together as a political community.


---

## Regime and Government Support

*Regime*: Demands &amp;rarr; Outputs

*Government*: Task takers
