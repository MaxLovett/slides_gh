*Objective*: Role of elites on achieving global targets in low- and middle-income countries

*Theory*: Classic elite theory

*Method*: Case of Uganda on Millennium Development Goal, Target 5 (MDG 5), 2000-2015; Interviews and focus group discussions

*Findings*: Elites' personal interests rather than the MDG 5 influences the countries maternal health policies.
- Elites control over the policy process

Straw poll: A straw poll, straw vote, or straw ballot is an ad hoc or unofficial vote.

The idiom may allude to a straw (thin plant stalk) held up to see in what direction the wind blows, in this case, the wind of group opinion.

- **Sampling**: Telephone directory in the United States, lists of magazine subscribers, rosters of clubs and associations, and other sources
- **Nonresponse**: 2.4 million response for 10 million request
- **Self-selection**: A high (inflated) rate of reported voting

George Gallup的美国民意研究所通过正确预测1936年大选的结果获得了国家认可，而盖洛普也正确地预测了大选的结果, sample size 50,000.

## Question Type

*Descriptive* questions

*Relational* questions

> Are men more conservative than women?

> Does the COVID-19 disproportionately and negatively affect the urban residents' income?


???

Questions designed for looking at the relationship between two or more variables

Causal questions

## Being Clear about the Components

How to measure political culture?

--

### Conceptualization

- Behavior or attitude
- Individual or group

--

### Measurement

.pull-left[
Likert scale:

1. Strongly disagree
1. Disagree
1. Neither agree nor disagree
1. Agree
1. Strongly agree
]

.pull-right[
Or 

1 to 7

1 to 10

1 to 100
]

---

### Theory

A logic of why: Y &larr; Xs

--

### Hypothesis

A .red[testable] statement about the empirical relationship between X and Y.

## Procedure for Conducting a Scientific Survey

.center[
Sampling

Designing questions

Interviewing

Mode of data collection

Total survey design
]

???

Interviewing, not necessary but a way to conduct surveys, starting with standardized questions, open questions at the end.

- Ensure consistency
- Scripted procedures and itneractions
- Avoid influencing the answers
- Limit unstructured discussion

Mode, in-perspon, telephone, etc.

Total design， procedure decisions to make

--

- The choice of whether or not to use a probability sample
- The sample frame (those people who actually have a chance to be sampled)
- The size of the sample
- The sample design (the particular strategy used for sampling people or households)
- The rate of response (the percentage of those sampled for whom data are actually collected)

## Errors Associated with Who Answers

Sampling error

- Representing a wrong population

???

Marketing polling often have this issue; volunteer survey also

--

- Detectable with hindsight checks (statistics)
    - Weights

--

- Cure: 
    - Large size
    - Random sampling. Well...


???

A good example is flipping coin. If we flip a coin at 10 time, on average, we know there 5 times we get head. but, we might get 5 heads and 5 tails this time, and 6 heads and 4 tails next time. or maybe, we are no lucky,and get 9 tails and 1 head, which should be rare. however, if we do it over and over, on average, you get 5 heads but there are some variations in your draws. the difference is from random drawn. the same logic when we do survey interview. By chance, sometimes there will be too many females in the sample, sometimes too few, but on average, a series of properly drawn samples will have very close to the same percentage of females as the population as a whole. we don’t interview the population, we interview the sample. results might be different from different samples. sampling error catch up the differences.

---

## Sampling Bias

Sampling errors often refer to .red[random] errors;     
Sampling bias is an error that is .red[systematic] in nature.

--

.center[Increasing the sample size is **NOT** the cure!!!]

--

How? 

1. Sample frame: who has a chance to be selected
2. Process of selecting: how are respondents are selected
3. Failure to collect answers from everyone: who in the sample answers the survey or specific questions

---

## Errors Associated with the Answers

$$x_i = t_i + e_i$$
i: The respondent   
x<sub>i</sub>: The answer   
t<sub>i</sub>: The true value   
e<sub>i</sub>: The error   

--

.center[Goal: Minimizing e<sub>i</sub>.]

NB: A dangerous "enemy", social/political desirability

--

**Validity**: A concept/measurement of the distance between the actual answer and true value.

- Both errors and biases lead to lower validity!


???

For example, we try to avoid to ask behaviors that happened a long ago. in last week, probably not in last month. how many time did you drive over speed in last year.
