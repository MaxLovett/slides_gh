## A Nutshell

.pull-left[
Elites have better skills and resources;

Masses are unorganized;

Elite governance is inevitable.
]

--

.pull-right[
Elites .red[have] the power;    

Elites .red[make] the rule;   

Masses .red[follow] the rule;   

Elites .blue[get] benefits; masses .red[suffer].

Governing elites; non-~; masses

Circulation of elites
- No progress in human history
- Democracy is a fraud
]

???

统治精英集团、非统治的精英集团和普通大众

社会的发展过程就是政治精英的无限循环过程，是一个精英集团衰落和另一个精英集团兴起的“精英循环”

Politcal class; non-~

Circulation of elites
- A perpetual condition of conflict
- A recycle of the elite

]

???

same as Pareto, circulation of elites

Elites that are superior organizational skills

精英的形成有两种方式：
- 渐变机制，即下层社会的一部分人地位不断上升，最终导致现有精英的新陈代谢，类似于精英的循环；
- 突生机制，即无论是被统治阶级还是统治阶级，都存在自己的精英，两种精英在权力斗争中发生相互替代，类似于精英再生产。

Unlike Marx, Mosca has not a linear concept of time, but a circular one

## Advanced Version of Elitism: Elite Democracy

- The society is controlled by elites
- Pluralistic elites: leading the interest groups
- Elites are morally responsible to the public

Leading not delegate interest groups

Not only mean monetary, but also education, social network, etc.

 Bush: MBA from Harvard Business School  
 Trump: UPenn, Wharton School

 Biden: University of Delaware and Syracuse University

In 1968, Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law, ranked 76th in his class of 85, after failing a course due to an acknowledged "mistake" when he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school.

## Application I

Mukuru, Moses et al. 2021. “‘The Actor Is Policy’: Application of Elite Theory to Explore Actors’ Interests and Power Underlying Maternal Health Policies in Uganda, 2000-2015.” *International Journal of Health Policy and Management* 10(7): 388–401.
]

*Objective*: Role of elites on achieving global targets in low- and middle-income countries

*Theory*: Classic elite theory

*Method*: Case of Uganda on Millennium Development Goal, Target 5 (MDG 5), 2000-2015; Interviews and focus group discussions
- Target 5: [Reduce by three quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio](https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/maternal.shtml)

*Findings*: Elites' personal interests rather than the MDG 5 influences the countries maternal health policies.
- Elites control over the policy process

## Once upon a time...

Newman, Johnston & Lown 2015

Exposure to higher levels of local income inequality

&darr;

Low-income people to view the United States as .red[divided];     
Low-income people identify themselves as the .red["have-not"]

## Empirical Examination


.pull-left[.center[<img src = "images/elite_solt1.png" height = 550>]]

???

More income, more unlikely to identify as the have-not

It looks significant, when inequality increases, the income's effect on identifying inequality
