# Analysis of Public Policy

(and why do you deserve to be remembered?)

???

Starting with "hello, how are you" and

1. You are controlled by public policies
1. You don't understand public policies, e.g., the electronic motobike policy
1. You'll learn about a thinking system instead of some techniques

Whether you'll be employed depends on .red[how many] of the interviewers remember your name (of course, in a positive way).
You only have .red[30 seconds] to introduce yourself. 
What would you do?

## Challenging

.center[<img src = "images/intro_monkDebate.jpg" height = 550>]

???

临济宗被称为“棒喝门庭”，家风严峻，禅机凛冽。以彻骨彻髓的般若智慧，鼎盛禅林。自古以来，禅者必须甘于落寞，甘于清凉，甘于寂静；远离浮华、热闹、远离名利！

“四照用、四料简、四宾主”，主要是用来衡量禅师接度人时对话的利钝得失其中的教法。前两个四法重在如何接度学人，而四宾主则重在使禅师摆脱被动。
