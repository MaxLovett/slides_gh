## So...what .magenta[is] this course about?

--

Long long time ago, like in 1927,...

.center[<img src="images/TaftHutchins.png" height = 400 />]

???

William Howard Taft: The 27th president of the United States and the tenth chief justice of the United States

Robert Maynard Hutchins: Dean of Yale Law School (28 yr old), 后president of the U of Chicago

---

## Chief Justice vs. Chancellor of the School

1927, Yale

--

[Taft:] “Well, I understand that at Yale you teach your students that judges are fools.”

--

[Hutchins:] “No, Mr. Chief Justice, at Yale we teach our students to find that out for themselves.”
