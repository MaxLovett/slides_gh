00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,870
 Rural North Carolina. 

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,240
Researchers from Duke University

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,760
 were working there on a long term

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,720
 study of mental health problems in

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,920
 a sample of nearly 1,500 children, 

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,610
about 1/4 of whom from

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,050
 the Cherokee reservation. 

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,050
In 1996, during the study,

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,290
the Cherokee Indians in

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,330
 North ca ro Li Na's great, 

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,250
smoky mountains opened a casino. 

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,430
But this was a casino with a difference. 

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,870
It was different because some of the profits

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,190
 from this casino were distributed equally

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,870
 amongst families on the reservation. 

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,540
And this lifted many of them out of poverty. 

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,820
And this was an absolutely fantastic

18
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,540
 opportunity for the researchers, 

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,250
because this new money was

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,850
 independent of anything the families

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,130
 had done for themselves. 

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,790
So it was literally a brand new factor. 

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,450
This gave the researchers Jane Costello and

24
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,810
 her colleagues a unique chance to test if

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,290
 ending family poverty had any effect on

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,850
 the mental health of the children. 

27
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,880
The finding surprised even

28
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,440
 the researchers themselves. 

29
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,080
In just 4 years after the study began, 

30
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,040
children whose families had moved out

31
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,640
 of poverty showed a 40% reduction in

32
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,720
 conduct and opposition disorders. 

33
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,820
But there was no significant change

34
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,340
 in conduct of Cherokee children

35
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,940
 who had not been living in poverty. 

36
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,020
This LED researches to conclude

37
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,900
 that poverty was a factor in some

38
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,300
 child mental health problems.
