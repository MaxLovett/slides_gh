# Experimental Analysis

---

## Experiment

.center[<img src="images/experiment.jpg" height = 300 />]

The origin, core, foundation of the empirical/applied science.

---

## Facts about Experimental Methods

1. Not every type of research in the lab is an experiment.

--

1. Not every experiment has to be conducted in the lab.

--

1. Not every method called "experiment" is an experiment.

--

1. Not every research question can be tested by an experiment.


---

## Why Experiment

.center[<img src="images/correlationCausation.jpg" height = 500 />]

---

## Logic of Counterfactual

.center[<img src="images/counterfactual.jpg" height = 500 />]

---

## When Sticking with the Observed

No .magenta[perfect] counterfactual cases

We have to see causation from correlations

--

---

## Solution: Watching from an Aggregated Level

.center[<img src="images/controlTreatment.png" height = 400 />]

--

How do we divide the groups?

---

## Randomization, Ta-Da~

.center[<img src="images/breakConfounder.jpg" height = 400 />]

Double-blind

---

## Result of Randomization

A .magenta[balanced] data

.center[<img src="images/balance-1.png" height = 400 />]

---

## Classical experiment

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

text_tb <- data.frame(
  Test = c("Pre", "Post"),
  Stim. = rep("Treatment", 2),
  NonStim. = rep("Control", 2)
)

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "lcc")%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25) %>%
    add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Assignment" = 2)) %>%
      column_spec(c(2,3), width = "6em")
```

## Validity

> The approximate truth of the inference or knowledge claim.  
---Morton & Williams (2010, 254)

+ Internal
+ External
+ Ecological

---

## Internal Validity

The approximate truth of the inference or knowledge claim .magenta[within] a target population studies.

+ Construct validity
+ Causal validity
+ Statistical validity
    
---

## External vs. Ecological Validities

* External validity: The approximate truth of the inference or knowledge claim .magenta[beyond] a target population studies.


* Ecological validity: Whether the methods, materials, and settings of the research are similar to a given target .magenta[environment].

## What's the Effect?

Rubin's causal model:

.center[<img src="images/rubin.jpg" height = 300 />]

--

+ Averaged treatment effect (ATE): $E(\tau_i) = E(Y_{i1}) - E(Y_{i0})$


---

## When Can You Use Experiments

1. Independence
1. Exclusion restriction
1. Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)
1. Montonicity
1. Nonzero causal effects of assignment on treatment

---

## Independence

### Definition

Subject will have the same effect regardless which group they are in.

E(Y<sub>i1</sub>|T<sub>i</sub> = 1) = E(Y<sub>i1</sub>|T<sub>i</sub> = 0);  
E(Y<sub>i0</sub>|T<sub>i</sub> = 1) = E(Y<sub>i0</sub>|T<sub>i</sub> = 0).

--

### Violation

* Nonrandom assignment
* Non-double-blind design

---

## Exclusion restriction

### Definition

Only treatment can make effects.

.center[<img src="images/exclusion.png" height = 200 />]

--

### Violation

* Subjects change their behaviors
* Third party effects

---

## SUTVA

### Definition

The effect of stimulus on one subject is affected by other subjects.

--

### Violation (e.g., Herd Effect)

.center[<img src="images/herdBehavior.jpg" height = 300 />]

---

## Montonicity and nonzero causal effects

### Definition

* The probability the subject is treated is at least as great when the subject is in the treatment group as when the subject is in the control group.
* The treatment assignment has an effect on the probability that at least some subjects are treated.

--

### Violation

* Operation errors
* Third-party effects

---

## When Experiment Is a Proper Choice?

* Well-defined concept 
* Clear-stated propositions
* Small-group interaction

---

## Field Experiment

.center[<img src="images/BanerjeeDuflo.jpg" height = 300 />]

* Subject: sample from the target population
* Pro: Ecological validity
* Con: Internal and external validity
