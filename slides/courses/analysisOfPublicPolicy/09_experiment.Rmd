.red[Average] treatment effect on the treated (ATT): $ATT = \mathbb{E}(\delta_i | T_i = 1).$

.red[Average] conditional treatment effect (ACTE):

$ATE(W) = \mathbb{E}(\delta_i|W_i); \boldsymbol Y \sim \boldsymbol W\boldsymbol\beta.$     
$ACTE(W) = \mathbb{E}(\delta_i | W_i, T_i = 1)$

ATE estimates the causal effect of treatment on a randomly drawn individual in the population
ATT estimates the causal effect of treatment on a randomly drawn untreated individual.

+ All possible states of the world are .red[observed].
+ The only causality question of interest is a .red[historical] one for the dataset analyzed.
+ The only causality question of interest is one in which treatment is received .red[before] a choice is made; there are no simultaneous relations between treatment and choice.

## Sensitive Question Technique

Commen strategies:

Endorsement experiment    
.small[(Exploiting evaluation bias)]

List experiment   
.small[(Aggregation)]

Randomized response   
.small[Adding random noise]
]

???

Endorsement: In the control group, respondents are asked to evaluate some relatively uncontroversial issue or object (e.g., rate a policy on a Likert scale). In the treatment group, that issue or object is associated with the sensitive item before being evaluated (e.g., the same policy is said to be endorsed by a controversial political group).

Randomized response: Using a coin to determine whether to answer the question or a given answer

Rosenfeld et al. 2014: The endorsement experiment and the randomized response yield least bias, but the estimates based on the endorsement experiment (with a single item) are noisier than other indirect questioning methods.
