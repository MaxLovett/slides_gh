## Madison's Pluralism

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, .magenta[adversed] to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.

## Preventing

.bg-red.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
党内绝不允许搞团团伙伙、结党营私、拉帮结派，搞了就是违反政治纪律。如何防微杜渐？要从规矩抓起，要有这个意识……有的人只要是他工作过的地方，都利用手中的权力“正正规规”地搞团团伙伙，全要搞成他自己的领地，到处插手人事安排，关照自己小圈子里的人，结果他们就成了一根绳上的蚂蚱。

## Tolerating

Control "only working in a republic", according to Madison

+ A .blue[large] one (diverse interest groups)
+ Under federalism (making .red[local] matter)

Not fit pure democracy:
+ Only the representatives can construct common interests.

The principle of popular sovereignty should prevent minority factions from gaining power.

.blue[Via] interest groups (Bentley) &rarr;

???

The government plays an active role in establishing the conditions for interest groups to act.

## Truman's Interest Group


### Strategic position
+ Status & prestige
+ Standing against the rule
+ Government members in the group
+ Usefulness as a source of information

--

### Internal characteristics
+ Degree of organization
+ Skills of the leadership
+ Resources/money

--

### Governmental Institutions
+ Operating structure
+ Groups' effects on particular branches of the government

+ Interest groups' .blue[characteristics] influence governmental decisions. 
+ Diversity makes policy-making .blue[flexible].


???

The interest groups' **strategic position** in the society (groups' status and prestige; their standing against the rules of the game; government membership in these groups; their usefulness as a source of information) and **internal characteristics** of both the interest groups (degree of organization; the skills of the leadership; and resources/money) and **governmental institutions** (operating structure; groups' effects on particular branches of the government) affect the influence on governmental decisions.  
The political structure of the U.S. government (federalism, liberty, rights) allows potential interest groups to rise and therefore play a role in representing interests.  
Diversity and will accommodate policy-making and will make it more flexible.

## Goods

A more general view beyond politics (just like neo-institutionalism over institutionalism)

Mancur Olson's Collective Action

Private: Software?  
Club: Water network?  
Common: Freshwater?  
Public: Dam?

1. Each additional contribution has an increasing effect on the public

## Solution: Bringing Institutions In

Ostrom, Elinor. 1990. *Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action*. Cambridge University Press.

Institutional arrangement for collective actions

+ People are .red[not] autonomous
+ Rules can .blue[reduce] collective action issues

???

Another Solution: Network & Cooperation

Social capital: .red[Credibility] solves the collective action

Cooperation

+ Activists: Seeking for central positions and more connections
+ Resource users: Embedding in .blue[smaller, denser] networks.

## Definition

> 狭义上理解的集体行动与集体行为(collective behavior)相接近,是相对于组织行动而言的组织外非集团 行动。奥尔森等人经济政治学分析框架中的集体行动的概念界定当属此类。然而,本研究所指的集体行动则与以上界定相区别, .magenta[既非指社会冲突意义上的群体行为,亦非特指非制度化的组织外行为,而是更广泛意义上利益相关者所采取的一致行为的过程]。 (魏娜, 张小进 2010: 13)
