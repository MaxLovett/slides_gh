## What's Case Study

> An intensive study of a .magenta[single unit] for the purpose of understanding a larger class of (similar) units ---Gerring (2004: 342).

### How to Identify a Case

Boundary of a Case:

+ Spatial
+ Temporal

--

Hey, unit of analysis!

---

## An Observation, Variable, Case or Unite?

```{r}
text_tb <- data.frame(Observed = 1:8,
                      Gender = rep(c("Male", "Female"), times = 4), 
                      Country = rep(c("US", "UK"), each = 4))

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "crr")%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25, bootstrap_options = c("responsive"))
```

---

## Common Components of a Case Study

### Target

Covariational relations

--

### Basic types

1. One unit over time
1. N subunit at one time
1. N subunit over time

--

All about .magenta[comparison]!! (Except for story-telling studies)

---
    
## Advanced Types

* Cross-sectional
* Time-series cross-sectional
* Hierarchical
* Comparative historical

---

## When are case studies useful?

* Deep rather than broad, bounded scope of proposition
* Comparing rather than represent other cases
* Mechanism rather than effect
* Deterministic rather than probabilistic relations
* Exploring rather than confirmatory test

--

* Don't forget transferable implication: what's a like/unlike case?

---

## Why don't we let the case be representative?

Randomization is cool, right?

Why not?!

---

## Fundamental Logic of Case Comparison

* Most similar systems
* Most different systems

---

## Concomitant variation (most similar systems)

> The belief that systems as similar as possible with respect to as many features as possible constitute the optimal samples for comparative inquiry.
---Przeworski and Teune (1970, 32)

---

Cases used in Hu, Yue, and Amy H. Liu. 2019. “The Effects of Foreign Language Proficiency on Public Attitudes.” *Journal of East Asian Studies*. 2020:

Mainland China, Taiwan of China, Singapore

## Leadership Powerfulness


```{r}
text_tb <- data.frame(US = c("American continent", "Broad territory", "Anglo-Saxon", "Democracy", "Federal", "Presidential"), 
                      Canada = c("American continent", "Broad territory", "Anglo-Saxon", "Democracy", "Federal", "Parliamentary"))
rownames(text_tb) <- c("Position", "Size", "Culture", "Polity", "Government", "Legislature")

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "cll")%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25, bootstrap_options = c("responsive"))
```

## Principles of the Most Similar System

Focus: .magenta[inter]systemic differences

--

Assumption: Characteristics shared by one group of systems, such as can be removed (control)

--

Explanatory: Difference

--

Control: Similarities between the systems

---

## Practice

1. How do we know if the policy of waste sorting works? 
1. What environmental policies (giving a pair of examples) is best for a given city? 
1. When another contagion comes, what should a local government do?
1. What forms the political correctness of a society? 

---

## Principles of Most Different systems

* Focus: .magenta[intra]systemic similarities and differences

--

* Assumption: systemic factors do not play any role in explaining the observed behavior.

--

* Explanatory: Similarity

--

* Control: Differences in the common systemic characteristics

---

## Practice

1. How do we know if the policy of waste sorting works? 
1. What environmental policies is best for a given city? 
1. When another contagion comes, what should a local government do?
1. What forms the political correctness of a society? 

Yeah, yeah, the same questions~~

---

## Comparison

```{r}
text_tb <- data.frame( Item = c("Assumption", "Focus", "Control", "Target"),
  MSS = c("Similarity is irrelevant", "Difference", "Shared properties", "Sufficiency"), 
  MDS = c("Differences is irrelevant", "Similarity", "Different features", "Necessity"))

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "lll") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
    column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
      column_spec(2:3, border_right = T)
```

---

## Bonus: Necessity vs. Sufficiency

*Necessity*: You won't see this without .magenta[that].

*Sufficiency*: You'll always see .magenta[that] when this happens.

--

.center[<img src="images/necessitySufficiency.png" height = 280 />]

---

## How to Choose?

Which should I use, MSS or MDS?

--

### Prerequisite:

Whether the variable of interests (usually the core independent variable) is embed in the same or different systems?

---

## How To Pick the Cases?

Core principle: Minimizing .magenta[selection bias]

.center[<img src="images/selectionBias.gif" height = 400 />]

---

## Different Selection, Different Consequences

.center[<img src="images/selectionX.png" height = 500 />]

???

Select X

---

.center[<img src="images/selectionY.png" height = 600 />]

???

Select Y

---

.center[<img src="images/selectionXY.png" height = 600 />]

???

Select XY

---

## Example of Selection Bias

.small[Question: Why new industrializing countries grows more rapidly?  
Theory: The repression of labor]

.center[<img src="images/seleCase.png" height = 300 />]

Problem?

???
Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan of China

---

class: small

## When Selection Is not a problem

* Theory-oriented
    + Labor repression contributes to growth in a mixed economy
    + Case selection: Communist countries can be excluded.
    
--

* Hypothesis-oriented
    + Theory: Military governments are more likely to negotiate their extrication from power
than are personalist regimes.
    + Hypothesis: Incidence of negotiation in military governments during the years in which breakdown occurs is higher than that in personalist regimes.
    + Case selection: Only breakdown regimes are select.
   
---
    
## Avoid Selection Bias

1. Being clear about the domain of the variables
1. Transparent coding sheet

---

## When Selection Can Be Useful

### Most similar/different systems

--

### Least-likely case

If the theory can make it here, it can make it anywhere.

--

### Deviant Cases

Cases that do not conform to the predictions made by the theory
