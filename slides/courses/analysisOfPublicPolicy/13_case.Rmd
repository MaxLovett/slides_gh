Legal case

Roe and Casey case that supreme court intend to overwrite

The decision involved the case of Norma McCorvey—known by the legal pseudonym "Jane Roe"—who in 1969 became pregnant with her third child. McCorvey wanted an abortion but lived in Texas, where abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the mother's life. Her attorneys, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local district attorney, Henry Wade, alleging that Texas's abortion laws were unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas heard the case and ruled in her favor. Texas then appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.

清河实验

1928年，燕京大学社会学家杨开道、许世廉等人就曾在这里做过一次著名的“清河实验”。他们在农村社区培养有威望的社区领袖，增强农民的自我组织能力，从经济、社会等多方面提出改良措施，为乡村振兴树立了优秀典范。

　　随着抗战爆发，持续9年的老“清河实验”被迫中断。数十年的岁月改变了清河的样貌，聚焦公众参与的社区治理经验却在这片土地延续。

　　2014年2月，清华大学课题组与海淀区政府合作，在清河街道开启了基层社会治理创新试点，即新“清河实验”。

## An Example of MSS

.center[Deng, Yang, Ma 2021]

- **Objective**: Relationship between local bureaucrats and mass protest
- **Theory**: Consent instability vs. Mobilized instability
- **Findings**: 
    1. Mass protest can becomes a leverage for inter-bureaucratic bargaining;
    1. Superior' response depends on the escalation of protest and the appearance of violence
    1. Superior's response depends on whether the local bureaucrats' role in the protest and can effectively control the event
- **Method**: MSS

# Mixed Method

## The "Perfect" Approach (Hmm...)

Terminology first:

> **Multimethodology** (or multimethod) research includes the use of more than one method of data collection or research in a research study or set of related studies. 

> **Mixed methods** research is more specific in that it includes the mixing of .red[qualitative and quantitative] data, methods, methodologies, and/or paradigms in a research study or set of related studies.

## An Example of Mixed Method

.center[Ma, Whiting, Zhang, Zhao 2022]

- **Objective**: Vote buying
- **Theory**: (Rent seeking) Lure of rents &rarr; vote buying
- **Findings**: 
    1. Lure of rents &rarr; competitiveness 
    1. Lure of rents &rarr; proportion of vote buying
    1. Vote buying &rarr; recruitment of rent-sharing coalition
- **Method**: Mixed method (case + survey)
    1. In-depth case study (> 70 interviews)
    1. Panel surveys

## Survey

- A multi-wave panel survey
    1. 2008: 2,000 households in 100 villages
    1. 2014: 1,240 households from a 60 village subsample
    
- Outcome variable: The overall vote-buying situation in the village’s most recent election
- Explanatory variable: Whether there was a land taking within one term of a village election
    - One term before or after the election
    - 3 yrs before
    - 3 yrs after

$$VB_i = c + \beta land\_taking_i + XB + alpha_k + \epsilon_i$$
- Result: land_taking significantly increased the probability of vote buying
