# Know Democratic support

## What's democratic support

> The way in which a person evaluatively *orients himself to some object* through either his attitudes or his behavior^["Specific support" [@Easton1975, p. 436].]......Some types of evaluations are closely related to what the political authorities do and how they do it. Others are [*more fundamental in character*]{.red}^["Diffuse support" [@Easton1975, p. 436].] because they are directed to basic aspects of the system.

[&dArr;]{.large}

[~~General patterns~~]{.large}        
[Three puzzles]{.large}

:::

## Puzzle 1: Support &rarr; Institutions

- Explicit support for democracy [@InglehartWelzel2005]
    - Support for democracy is the **foundation** of regime sustainability [@Easton1965; @Lipset1959].
    - "Fading allure"  &rarr; 
        - Support for populist parties [@Plattner2017]
        - Discontent with democratic norms [@FoaMounk2016; @FoaMounk2017]
        - A crisis of institutional trust [@WikeFetterolf2018].
- Is support for democracy really the "foundation"?
    1. **Diffuse** support *vs* **specific** support [@Easton1975;@Norris2011].
    2. Democratic **enlightenment** [@AcemogluEtAl2009] *vs*    
      Democratic **consolidation** [@Boix2011; @PrzeworskiLimongi1997].

:::{.notes}
The Lipset-Easton theory of democratic support provides a comprehensive explanation of the link between public sentiment and regime dynamics.

The concept of the "fading allure of liberal democracy" refers to the increasing disillusionment with democratic norms and institutions worldwide.

Diffuse support vs. specific support:
    - The former is more crucial for the endurance of democracy.
:::

## Puzzle 2: Support &larr; Institutions

- Democratic institutions *automatically* generate demand for themselves, and this demand fosters support [@Dalton2004; @MishlerRose2007].
    1. Democratic socialization
    2. Lifelong learning theory
- **Thermostatic** model [@Wlezien1995; @Claassen2020a].
    1. Authoritarian nostalgia &rarr; (majority) electoral democracy.
    2. Minority discrimination &rarr; (protective) minoritarian democracy.

:::{.notes}
Authoritarian nostalgia plays a role in shaping attitudes towards democracy.

## Puzzle 3: Data Proliferation vs. Pattern Consensus

1. Democracy  &rarr; Public Opinion: Stable democratic institutions [weaken]{.red} democratic support (thermostatic effect).
    - Democracy [&uarr;]{.green}  &rarr; Support [&uarr;]{.green} [@WuttkeEtAl2020a]
    - Democracy [&uarr;]{.green}  &rarr; Support [&darr;]{.red} [@FoaMounk2017]
        - Weakening of *electoral* and *minoritarian* institutions.
1. Public Opinion  &rarr; Democracy: Democratic support correlates [positively]{.green} with the development of democratic institutions
    - Support [&uarr;]{.green}  &rarr; Democracy [&uarr;]{.green} [@InglehartWelzel2005]
    - Support [&uarr;]{.green}  &rarr; Democracy [&#8675;]{.red} [@FailsPierce2010]
      - Strengthens in *established democracies* and in *non-democratic regimes*.

:::{.notes}

Inglehart, Ronald, and Christian Welzel (2005): Countries with greater democratic support tend to become more stable and robust democracies.

Fails, Matthew D., and Heather Nicole Pierce (2010): Insignificant positive with one-year survey, and insig negative with multiple years

Thermostatic effect theory suggests that stable democracies experience declining public support.

This breaks from a solitary focus on voting and ensures the people's rights to democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management, and oversight.
