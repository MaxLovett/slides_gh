## Large N & Leeuwenhoek

.center[

\begin{aligned}
\sigma^2 =& \sum(X - \mu)^2p(x),\\
=& \sum(X^2 -2X\mu + \mu^2)p(x),\\
=& \sum X^2p(x) - 2\mu\sum Xp(x) + \mu^2\sum p(x). \\
=& \sum X^2p(x) - \mu^2,
\end{aligned}

]

+ Meaning of equations
+ Tricks in the concepts, terms, and process

E.g., 

What does randomization actually do?

Do you need to worry about multicollinearity?

How do you explain the interactive term in a conditional-effect model?

The .red[only] way to understand and evaluate an empirical analysis filly is to know the exact process by which the data were generated and the analysis produced.

## Who Don't Need to Take This Course

1. Taking econometrics already;
1. Having no interests of large-n analysis;
1. Having no interests in social science;
1. Not want to come and talk;
1. Lack of self-responsibility;
1. Not having an .red[open] mind.

.huge[Hey,    
why DAMN English?!]

???

1. One of the goals is to being competitive;
1. More sources in English;
1. Software in English
1. Zhuangbility: heteroscedasiticity, endogeneity, multicollinearity...
