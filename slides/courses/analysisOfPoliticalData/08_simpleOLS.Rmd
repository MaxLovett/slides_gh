# Understanding OLS
## Theoretical and Methodological Views

---

## Theory

General statement to describe causality and relevant phenomena.

### Good theory

1. Large explanatory power
    + Importance: How much X affects Y
    + Range: generality
    + Applicability: How often affecting in the reality
1. Parsimony
1. Satisfying elaboration
1. Clearly framed (formal?)
1. Falsifiable
1. Explaining important phenomena
1. Prescriptive richness (and policy recommendation)

## How to Test a Theory (Causal Inference)

1. Hoop tests: Predictions of high certitude and no uniqueness provide decisive negative test
1. Smoking-gun tests: Predictions of high uniqueness and no certitude provide decisive positive tests:
1. Double-decisive tests: Predictions of high uniqueness and high certitude
1. Straw-in-the-wind tests: Predictions of low uniqueness and low certitude

(Evera, Stephen Van. 1997. Guide to Methods for Students of Political Science. Ithaca: Cornell University Press.)

???

1. Hoop test: the accused in the state when murder happens? If not innocent, but passing does not mean being guilty.
1. Smoking-gun test: a smoking gun seen in a suspect's hand moments after a shooting is quite conclusive proof of guilt, but a suspect not seen with a smoking gun is not proven innocent.
1. Double-decisive test: hoop + smoking-gun, like a camera record
1. Straw-in-the-wind test: Richard Liu seemed friendly with the girl.

## Ordinary Least Squares

One type of simulation of the reality (and one of a variety of types).

.red[NOT OFFERING CAUSALITY.]

### Used it properly

1. Always getting attention to the detailed data
1. Don't let the data drive you, you drive the data with appropriate methods.

## What We Already Know

* Population vs. sample

--

* Parameter vs. statistics

--

* Random variable 

???

a variable following a distributive feature, but no fixed value before creation.

--

* Distribution

???

For each value of a random variable X, the distribution tells us the probability of that value.

--

* Joint, marginal, and conditional distributions

???

Joint: $f(X_1, X_2) = P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2)$
Marginal: the integral of $f(X_1) or f(X_2)$ to the other variable
Conditional: $f(X_1|X2 = x_2)$

---

* Expectation:

\begin{align}
E(X)_{discrete} =& \sum^n_{i = 1} X_if(X_i)\\
E(X)_{continuous} =& \int^{+\infty}_{-\infty}X_if(X_i)dX.
\end{align}

* Variance:

\begin{align}
\sigma^2 = E[X - E(X)]^2 =& E[(X - \mu)^2]\\
              =& E(X^2 - 2X\mu + \mu^2)\\
              =& E(X^2) - 2\mu E(X) + \mu^2\\
              =& E(X^2) - \mu^2
\end{align}

???

Expectation is the mean.

### Rule of variance

1. $var(aX + b) = a^2var(X);$
1. $var(aX_1 + bX_2 + c) = a^2var(X_1) + b^2var(X_2) + 2ab\cdot cov(X_1, X_2).$
1. When $X_i$ is i.i.d., 
$var(a1X_1 + a_2X_2 + \cdots + a_nX_n) = var(\sum a_iX_i) = \sum a_i^2var(X_i)$
1. $var(\bar X) = var(\frac{\sum X_i}{n}) = \sum^n_{i = 1}\frac{var(X_i)}{n^2} = \frac{n\sigma^2}{n^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$
1. $cov(X, Y) = E(XY) - E(X)E(Y)$
    + When X = Y, $cov(X, X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2 = var(X)$


???
\begin{align}
var(aX + b) =& E[(aX + b) - E(aX + b)]^2\\
            =& E[aX + b - aE(X) - b]^2\\
            =& E[aX - aE(X)]^2 = a^2E[X - E(X)]^2 = a^2var(X)
\end{align}

\begin{align}
cov(X, Y) =& E[X - E(X)][Y - E(Y)]\\
          =& E[XY - XE(Y) - YE(X) + E(X)E(Y)]\\
          =& E(XY) - E(Y)E(X) - E(X)E(Y) + E(X)E(Y)\\
          =& E(XY) - E(X)E(Y)
\end{align}

## Property of Estimator $\hat \theta$

* Unbiased: On average, the estimator gives the right answer, formally, $E(\hat\sigma) = \sigma.$
* Consistent: As the sample size increases, the variance decreases.

```{r consistency, fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 40)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dgamma(x, shape = 9, scale = .5), aes(color = "n1")) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dgamma(x, shape = 9, scale = 1), aes(color = "n2")) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dgamma(x, shape = 9, scale = 2), aes(color = "n3")) +
  ylab("Probability Density") + 
  xlab("X") +
  labs(color = "Distribution")
```

???

Consistency: n1 < n2 < n3

---

* Efficiency: Smallest variance among unbiased estimators

```{r efficacy, fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-7, 7)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 0.5), aes(color = "n1")) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1), aes(color = "n2")) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 2), aes(color = "n3")) +
  ylab("Probability Density") + 
  xlab("X") +
  labs(color = "Distribution")
```

* RMES: Root mean square error, $\sqrt{bias^2 + var}$
    + Trade off a little bias against variance.

# Regression
## Getting the mean right is a good thing
---Frederick J. Boehmke

## What Does Regressions Deal with?

How does some outcome variable Y change with some explanatory variable X? 

E.g., Are the political ideology of the three types of voters different? 

$\mu_D = \mu_I = \mu_R.$

$\text{diff} = \frac{\bar X_R - \bar X_D}{SE}.$

## Linearity

Y changes linearly with X.

In terms of the population regression function,

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + u_i$$

Therefore, 

\begin{align}
E(Y_i|X_i) =& E(\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + u_i|X_i)\\
           =& E(\beta_0|X_i) + E(\beta_1X_1|X_i) + E(u_i|X_i)\\
           =& \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + E(u_i|X_i)
\end{align}

???

$\beta_1X_i$ consistent

E(u_i|X_i) assumed 0

---

Q. Which one shows a linear relationship between X and Y?

\begin{align}
Y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + ui\\
Y_i =& \beta_0 + \frac{\beta_1}{X_i} + ui\\
Y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1ln(X_i) + ui\\
Y_i =& \beta_0 + X_i^{\beta_1} + ui\\
Y_i =& \frac{1}{\beta_0} + \frac{X_i}{\beta_1} + ui
\end{align}

???

First three are linear.

The last one isn't linear until redefining.

---

\begin{align}
Y_i =& E(Y_i|X_i) + u_i\\
\Leftrightarrow u_i =& Y_i - E(Y_i|X_i)
\end{align}

There are things we don't know (or human errors).
