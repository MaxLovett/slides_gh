# What's a case study

> An intensive study of a .magenta[single unit] for the purpose of understanding a larger class of (similar) units.

### A Case

A unit within a boundary

+ Spatial
+ Temporal
]

.pull-right[
### Types of cases

1. One unit over time
1. N subunit at one time
1. N subunit over time

Hint: .red[Varying] is the key!

## Differentiation: Observation, Variable, or Case

```{r unitCase}
text_tb <- data.frame(Observed = 1:8,
                      Party = rep(c("Party Member", "Non-PM"), times = 4), 
                      Region = rep(c("Educational", "Dependents"), each = 4))

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "crr")%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25, bootstrap_options = c("responsive"))
```


---

### Representativeness of Cases

Randomization is cool, right?

Why not randomly bring a case to analyze?


???

Representativeness roots from large-N analysis

---

## Goal of Case Study

*General goals*

+ Credibility
+ Transferability
+ Dependability
+ Confirmability

--

*In terms of case studies*

You should conduct a case study when you are looking for...

* .red[Deep] rather than broad, bounded scope of proposition
* .red[Comparing] with rather than represent other cases
* .red[Mechanism] rather than effect
* .red[Deterministic] rather than probabilistic relations
* .red[Exploring] rather than confirmatory test

## A Nonacademic Example

<video width="1000" height="200" controls preload>
    <source src="https://link.jscdn.cn/1drv/aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3YvcyFBcnR0dk83MHdLSU8yMHk2MmJ5dzRXa2xxWF9MP2U9VVFtWFdq.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

- What's the .red[problem] did the upper intend to solve?
- What product does she .red[select], and why?
- How did she do it?
    - What **logic** did she apply?
    - What **empirics** did she provide?
        - How do they **relate to** the problem?
- What .red[conclusions] did she draw? 
- Are you **convincing**, and why specifically?
    - Can you do better?

```{r stopwatch1, echo = FALSE}
library(countdown)

countdown(
  minutes = 2,
  seconds = 0,
  warn_when = 30,
  right = "0%",
  bottom = "5%",
  font_size = "3.5em",
  play_sound = TRUE
)

```

---

## Descriptive Case Study

Goal: Details and Mechanisms

--

 Approach:

- Clear question
- Detailed narrative
- Calling back to the questions
- Extension (more than the initial question)

--

 Quality: Credibility > Confirmability > Transferability > Dependability

</video>

- What's the .red[problem] did the upper intend to solve?
- What products does he .red[select], and why?
- How did he do it?
    - What **logic** did he apply?
    - What **empirics** did he provide?
        - How do they **relate to** the problem?
- What .red[conclusions] did he draw? 
- Are you **convincing**, and why specifically?
    - Can you do better?

```{r stopwatch2, echo = FALSE}

  seconds = 0,
  warn_when = 30,
  right = "0%",
  bottom = "5%",
  font_size = "3.5em",
  play_sound = TRUE
)

```

## Analytic case study

Goal: Testing inferences

--

 Approach:

.pull-left[
- Clear question
- Careful case selection (elaborated later)
- Delicate design of comparison
- General conclusion
]

.pull-right[

.gray[
- Clear question
- Detailed narrative
- Calling back to the questions
- Extension (more than the initial question)
]

 Quality: Credibility = Confirmability = Transferability = Dependability

## Fundamental Logic

Most .red[similar] systems    
Most .red[different] systems

---

## Most Similar Systems (Concomitant Variation)

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
The belief that systems as similar as possible with respect to as many features as possible constitute the optimal samples for comparative inquiry.

.tr[
--- Przeworski and Teune (1970, 32)
]
]

???

Raoul Naroll, “Some Thoughts on Comparative Method in Cultural Anthropology."

Concomitant: something that happens at the same time as another thing and is connected with it.

--

**Explanatory Variable**: intersystemic .red[differences]

--

**Control Variables**: .red[Similarities] between the systems

--

**Assumption**: Characteristics shared by one group of systems, such as can be .red[removed].

## E.g.: About Leadership Powerfulness

```{r leadership}
text_tb <- data.frame(US = c("American continent", "Broad territory", "Anglo-Saxon", "Democracy", "Federal", "Presidential"), 
                      Canada = c("American continent", "Broad territory", "Anglo-Saxon", "Democracy", "Federal", "Parliamentary"))
rownames(text_tb) <- c("Position", "Size", "Culture", "Polity", "Government", "Legislature")

kable(text_tb, "html", align = "cll")|>
  kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 25, bootstrap_options = c("responsive"))
```

What argument can this study make?

## Practice
.pull-left[
Beijing's waste-sorting policy works?

.center[<img src="images/case_wasteSorting.png" height = 200 />]
]
.pull-right[
Cooling-off period works?
.center[<img src="images/case_coolingOff.png" height = 250 width = 500 />]

]

1. Define an outcome variable
1. Pick an explanatory variable
1. Make a most-similar-case study design
1. Descriptive (the conditions of) the cases 
1. Writing out and shoot to our class chat group in .red[10min]

```{r stopwatch3, echo = FALSE}
library(countdown)

countdown(
  minutes = 10,
  seconds = 0,
  warn_when = 30,
  right = "0%",
  bottom = "5%",
  font_size = "3.5em",
  play_sound = TRUE
)

```

---

## Most Different System

.bg-black.golden.ba.shadow-5.ph4.mt3[
The alternative strategy takes as the starting point the variation of the
observed behavior at a level lower than that of systems...If the relationship between an independent and the dependent variable is the same within the subgroups of the population, then again the systemic differences need not be taken into consideration.

.tr[
--- Przeworski and Teune (1970, 34--35)
]
]

--

**Explanatory Variable**: intrasystemic .red[similarities]

--

**Control Variables**: .red[Differences] in the common systemic characteristics

--

**Assumption**: Systemic factors .red[do not play any role] in explaining the observed behavior.

## E.g.: About the Cause of the Revolution

.center[<img src="images/case_skocpol.png" height = 550 />]

???

Skocpol, Theda. 1979. *States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China*. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.


Causes of revolution:

First, there must be a "crisis of state," often provoked by international factors.

Second, patterns of class dominance determine which group will rise up to exploit the revolutionary situation.
