## Ways to defend your case selection

1. **Relevance**: The case represents a significant or typical [empirical instance]{.red} of a phenomenon, providing rich data.
   - > Examining the 2016 US presidential election provides empirical data crucial for understanding contemporary electoral behavior and polarization.
   - > The lessons from Sweden’s welfare state can be generalized to other advanced economies facing similar social challenges.
2. **Comparison**: The case offers a unique point of [comparison ]{.red} that can help understand broader patterns or anomalies.
   - > Comparing the political systems of Singapore and Malaysia allows us to explore the divergent paths of development under similar initial conditions.
   - > Analyzing healthcare systems in Canada and the US offers comparative leverage to understand the impact of different health policy approaches.

3. **Deviance**: The case [deviates from expected]{.red} patterns, offering insights into exceptions and prompting theory refinement.
   - > China’s sustained economic growth without Western democratization challenges conventional theories of development and democracy.
   - > Singapore’s economic success without liberal democracy is a deviant case that challenges established theories of development.
4. **Illustration**: The case [vividly illustrates]{.red} a particular process or mechanism, making abstract concepts more concrete.
   - > The case study of Rwanda’s post-genocide reconciliation provides a clear illustration of the mechanisms of peacebuilding and transitional justice.
   - > The example of Brazil’s participatory budgeting process illustrates the practical application and outcomes of participatory governance.

:::{.notes}
### 1. **Forensic Investigation**
#### Example: The Murder of O.J. Simpson's Ex-Wife, Nicole Brown Simpson
- **Context:** In the investigation of Nicole Brown Simpson's murder, detectives gathered evidence from the crime scene and examined various suspects.
- **Process:** Investigators eliminated suspects who had alibis or lacked motive, opportunity, or means to commit the crime.
- **Result:** Despite being highly improbable to some, the remaining evidence pointed to O.J. Simpson as the prime suspect, leading to his arrest and trial. This case highlighted the principle of deductive reasoning in forensic science.

### 2. **Medical Diagnosis**
#### Example: Diagnosing Rare Diseases
- **Context:** Patients with rare diseases often experience a long diagnostic journey where common diseases are initially suspected.
- **Process:** Doctors conduct tests to rule out common conditions that fit the symptoms.
- **Result:** When common diseases are ruled out, doctors consider rare or less likely conditions. For example, diagnosing a rare genetic disorder like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) often involves ruling out other connective tissue disorders first.

### 3. **Scientific Discovery**
#### Example: Discovery of the Higgs Boson
- **Context:** Physicists at CERN sought to confirm the existence of the Higgs boson, a fundamental particle predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics.
- **Process:** Through experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), scientists ruled out other particles and interactions that could explain the observed data.
- **Result:** After eliminating other possibilities, the evidence pointed to the existence of the Higgs boson, leading to its discovery in 2012, despite its elusive nature.

### 4. **Aviation Accident Investigation**
#### Example: Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370
- **Context:** In the search for the missing MH370 flight, investigators considered various scenarios including mechanical failure, pilot error, hijacking, and terrorism.
- **Process:** Through extensive analysis of radar, satellite data, and debris, many possibilities were ruled out.
- **Result:** While the exact cause remains uncertain, eliminating other explanations narrowed the focus to scenarios involving deliberate human action or catastrophic failure, guiding ongoing search and investigation efforts.

### 5. **Historical Investigation**
#### Example: Identifying the Cause of the Black Death
- **Context:** Historians and scientists debated the cause of the Black Death, which devastated Europe in the 14th century.
- **Process:** Various theories included bubonic plague, anthrax, and other diseases. Modern research involving genetic analysis of remains ruled out some of these diseases.
- **Result:** The identification of Yersinia pestis DNA in ancient remains confirmed the bubonic plague as the primary cause, despite initial skepticism due to the speed and mortality of the epidemic.

### 6. **Legal Trials**
#### Example: The Innocence Project
- **Context:** The Innocence Project works to exonerate wrongfully convicted individuals through DNA testing and reevaluation of evidence.
- **Process:** By eliminating the possibility that the convicted individual was the perpetrator through new evidence, they uncover the truth.
- **Result:** Many individuals, such as Kirk Bloodsworth, have been exonerated after eliminating the impossibility of their guilt with DNA evidence, revealing the truth of their innocence.

:::{.notes}
### 1. **Studying and Grades**
#### Example: Study Time and Test Scores
- **Observation:** When you spend more time studying for a test, your test scores tend to be higher. When you study less, your test scores tend to be lower.
- **Conclusion:** There is a relationship between the amount of time spent studying and the grades you get. More studying generally leads to better grades.

### 2. **Rain and Umbrella Sales**
#### Example: Rainy Days and Umbrella Sales
- **Observation:** On days when it rains, more umbrellas are sold at stores. On sunny days, fewer umbrellas are sold.
- **Conclusion:** There is a relationship between the weather and umbrella sales. Rainy weather increases the sale of umbrellas.

### 3. **Ice Cream Sales and Temperature**
#### Example: Ice Cream Sales and Hot Weather
- **Observation:** When the temperature goes up, ice cream sales increase. When the temperature goes down, ice cream sales decrease.
- **Conclusion:** There is a relationship between the temperature and ice cream sales. Hot weather leads to more people buying ice cream.

### 4. **Physical Activity and Fitness**
#### Example: Exercise and Fitness Levels
- **Observation:** Kids who play sports and exercise regularly tend to be fitter and have more energy. Kids who don't exercise as much tend to be less fit.
- **Conclusion:** There is a relationship between physical activity and fitness. More exercise leads to better fitness levels.

### 5. **Screen Time and Sleep**
#### Example: Screen Time and Amount of Sleep
- **Observation:** When you spend a lot of time on screens (like watching TV or playing video games) before bed, you have a harder time falling asleep and get less sleep. When you spend less time on screens, you fall asleep more easily and get more sleep.
- **Conclusion:** There is a relationship between screen time and sleep. More screen time before bed can lead to less sleep.

### 6. **Practice and Skill Improvement**
#### Example: Playing a Musical Instrument
- **Observation:** The more you practice playing the piano, the better you get at it. When you don't practice, your skills don't improve as much.
- **Conclusion:** There is a relationship between practice and skill improvement. More practice leads to better piano playing skills.

### 7. **Healthy Eating and Energy Levels**
#### Example: Eating Vegetables and Feeling Energetic
- **Observation:** When you eat more vegetables and healthy foods, you have more energy throughout the day. When you eat junk food, you feel tired and sluggish.
- **Conclusion:** There is a relationship between what you eat and how much energy you have. Healthy eating leads to higher energy levels.

### 8. **Homework Completion and Free Time**
#### Example: Finishing Homework and Having Free Time
- **Observation:** When you finish your homework quickly, you have more free time to play. When you take a long time to do your homework, you have less free time.
- **Conclusion:** There is a relationship between homework completion and free time. Finishing homework faster leads to more time to play.
