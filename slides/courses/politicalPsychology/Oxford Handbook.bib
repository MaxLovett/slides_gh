In particular, this chapter focuses on the association between personality and political ideology, voting behavior, political loyalties, political participation, political engagement, and news consumption. The chapter concludes by outlining a research agenda for the next generation of research with attention to the assumed causal effects of personality on political ``outcomes.'' Future research is also encouraged to adopt open science practices that will increase transparency, replicability, and ultimately the field's credibility.},

  abstract = {This chapter reviews how biological evolution has shaped human political psychology and how political psychologists can approach the study of evolution and politics. The core argument of the evolutionary approach to political psychology is that our ancestors repeatedly faced political problems as part of their small-scale social life. If evolution had not designed the human mind to deal with these problems, our ancestors would not have survived and reproduced. Accordingly, political psychologists should expect the human mind to contain a large number of psychological mechanisms specifically dedicated to political decision-making. The chapter outlines the general political problems faced by our ancestors; illustrates the evolutionary approach through in-depth discussions of the politics of pathogen avoidance, cheater detection, and status seeking; provides concrete advice on how to theorize about political psychology from an evolutionary perspective; and discusses how an evolutionary perspective sheds new light on classical discussions about citizens' rationality.},

Next, the chapter reviews the main findings in this burgeoning literature. It describes the links between moral attitudes and ideology and, in particular, possible ideological asymmetry in moral thinking, and moves to review the role of morality as a source of elite rhetoric, a vehicle for political activism, a driver of extremism and polarization, and a key dimension in voter evaluations of politicians. This is followed by a discussion of measurement, and finally concludes with thoughts about the future of the field.},

The model predicts (or prescribes) how individuals will (or should) choose from alternative courses of action given their objectives and beliefs about the instrumental relationship between those alternatives and their goals. The economic version of the theory assumes perfect, unbounded, or substantive rationality, while bounded rationality assumes that peoples' decision-making procedures and the quality of their decisions will vary by the demands of the problem and the abilities, goals, and motivations of the decision-maker. This chapter explores the economic and the psychological rationality of political choice by evaluating the attitudes and behavior of citizens against this normative and empirical model in various decision-making contexts. It assesses the degree to which people pursue their self-interest, whether and when individuals can make good decisions with limited information, the circumstances in which beliefs are updated and information is processed rationally, and the consistency and coherence of preferences across alternative framings of issues.},

The second perspective is an interventionist one, focusing on the way emotional change (or regulation) can promote conciliatory attitudes and behaviors among the conflict's involved parties. The following chapter offers an integrative model, bringing together both the descriptive and the interventionist approaches.

We outline when and why people seek to influence group-based hierarchy: seeking to maintain or enhance an existing hierarchy, by protecting or improving the relative position of dominant groups, respectively. Or, people may seek to mitigate or rearrange group-based hierarchy, changing groups' relative positions to improve the position of marginalized groups and either flattening the distance between groups or maintaining the amount of hierarchy, respectively. We discuss research on how people react if a hierarchy is perceived to be under these different states (e.g., maintained, enhanced, mitigated, rearranged) and end with open questions and opportunities for future work.},

One key conclusion that we draw is that the links between psychological attributes and subsets of ideological attitudes sometimes appear to be organic and functional but other times appear to be conditional on how the relevant attitudes are packaged with other attitudes into socially constructed ideologies. A second key conclusion is that the social motives that induce citizens to pull diverse attitudes into ideological alignment may also, in polarized contexts, induce people to adopt non-political identities and self-perceptions that are congruent with ideological stereotypes. We recommend a focus on the implications of these processes for polarization and democratic stability.},

We highlight a conceptualization of authoritarianism that identifies the desire for social cohesion and defense of ingroup norms as central to the dynamics of authoritarianism. The consequences of authoritarianism---intolerance of dissent, out-group animosity, and support for anti-democratic leaders and parties---are a result of the experience of threat to social cohesion among those with authoritarian predispositions. Threats may be associated with processes of social change (changing gender norms) or changes to the status of the majority group from immigration. There is also some evidence that those low in authoritarianism may respond to existential threats (terrorism) with support for increased security. The role of threat in the dynamics of authoritarianism helps to provide a basis for understanding the conditions under which authoritarianism becomes a politically potent force.},

The chapter reviews existing research that traces how motivations influence who engages in which mode of information processing, under which conditions. The framework deepens our understanding of a wide range of political phenomena, such as when people update their attitudes in response to new information, when they counterargue against new information, how partisanship influences decision-making, and how to understand the problem of misinformation.

  abstract = {This chapter provides a general framework for studying individual political decision-making that applies to both everyday citizens and to political elites. Focusing primarily on mass behavior, it presents this framework within a broader cognitive perspective of humans as limited-capacity information processors who have developed at least two quite distinct modes of processing, one preconscious, automatic, low effort, and extremely fast (System 1); the other conscious, volitional, high effect, and relatively slow (System 2). After a brief foray into rational choice theory, the chapter spends much more time with behavioral decision theory and its bounded rationality perspective on how people normally cope with their cognitive limits. The strengths and weaknesses of various methods for studying decision-making are reviewed. Four broad types of decision strategies are discussed: dispassionate, confirmatory, fast and frugal, and intuitive. The effects of integral and incidental emotions on decision-making are also reviewed. The chapter concludes by considering the effects of decision strategy on decision quality and learning.},

Such identities sit uncomfortably with normative ideals of democratic behavior because they can result in political behavior that is at odds with the ideal democratic citizen as rational, objective, and fully informed. Nonetheless, social identification with political groups drives political behavior and informs the study of citizens' participation, organization, and judgment. This chapter reviews the application of social-psychological theories concerning social identity and intergroup conflict to political behavior. More specifically, the chapter reviews evidence on the effects of political identities on information processing, political action, political emotions, and prejudice against political opponents. The chapter makes clear that while voter political behavior is not often ``rational'' from an individual economic perspective, it is in line with predictable psychological motivations.},

Early 20th century research focused on ``charismatic'' leaders, with Frankfurt School sociologists invoking Freudian principles to explain charismatic leadership and followership. Subsequent research focused on a match between context and leadership style. More recently, research has returned to the question of why some leaders have strong charismatic appeal and the capacity to cultivate followership. The social identity approach to political leadership advanced in this chapter offers a radical (fourth) alternative to this traditional individualistic analysis by focusing on the social and psychological group processes that leaders activate and engage with. In this approach, leadership results from a process of effective ``identity entrepreneurship'' in which influence derives from would-be leaders' (a) capacity to redefine followers' shared self-understanding, and (b) ability to present their political projects as epitomizing ``who we are,'' ``what we are about,'' and ``who we want to be.''},

We call on political psychologists to develop more unified theories that study the growing array of subordinated groups, with the goal of isolating the psychological mechanisms behind their politics. We model one response to this call by drawing on social identity theory and its offshoots to illuminate some of the cognitive and affective roots of minority status and its implications for inter- and intra-group behavior in politics. We discuss the micro-foundations of minority group formation, the structural roots of minority status, and, most critically, the connections between minority status and political attitudes and behavior. We conclude by discussing three broad areas where scholars can use these insights to (re)invigorate debates in studies of minority group politics.},

Although certain facets of the research agenda have inspired controversy, there has come to be wide recognition that biological approaches to understanding politics---often rooted in evolutionary perspectives---can be informative and complementary to a broad range of topics within political psychology, such as attitudes, identity, participation, interest, sophistication, and information processing.},

The chapter first examines five non-psychological explanations of threat perception that scholars of international relations have identified and then moves to the analysis of cognitive and emotion-driven theories of threat perception. Perception is closely connected to the predictions and judgments that motivate action. Especially important in processes of threat perception are cognitive patterns and heuristics, information processing, emotional states, patterns of inference and attribution, and patterns of assessment of the likelihood and intensity of threat (Kahneman and Tersky, 1983). The chapter concludes by situating these theories within broader explanations by evolutionary psychologists of threat perception.},

Instead, we contend that promoting prejudice reduction at the relational level, and social change toward equality at the societal level, may be regarded as dual goals to be pursued in tandem, rather than necessarily being regarded as goals in conflict. With this lens, we review a number of theoretical perspectives on prejudice reduction and social change, including literature on intergroup contact, common group identities, and social norms. We conclude with suggestions for integrative research that can fill gaps in the existing literature, and we discuss implications of such work for interventions that seek to reduce prejudice and promote greater social equality.},

The dynamics of supply are about organizations and their appeals. The dynamics of mobilization concern the convergence of demand and supply. In the mobilization section, we specifically consider how classic social capital factors such as social trust and embeddedness in organizations and more recent developments of virtualization influence who does or does not participate in protest activity. Subsequently we discuss how the social and political psychological processes of politicization, polarization, and radicalization hinder or spur participation in collective action. Finally, we show how perceptions of the political context influence the decision to protest or not, focusing on socio-economic, political, and cultural contextual factors. In doing so, we provide an overview of what social and political psychology, combined with other disciplines, has to offer to the study of social movements and collective action, where we stand, and where we think the lacunas are. We end with a discussion of the challenges by those who study social movement participation.},

Today's media users experience decentralized, interpersonal, horizontal, networked politically relevant communication every day. Users experience socially contextualized messaging within a networked system that is predicated on the economics and logics of media fragmentation and micro-segmentation. Message producers, political campaigns, and social media platforms integrate users' social psychological characteristics into messaging content, aesthetics, and dissemination strategies. This chapter outlines how these qualitative changes necessitate a reimagining of the field of political communication. The shift away from traditional mass media models to networked, decentralized media systems through digital technologies has crucial implications for: (a) the scope of what constitutes political communication and (b) the integration of political psychology into the study of political communication.},
